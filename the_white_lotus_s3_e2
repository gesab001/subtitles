- (SIGHS)
- CHELSEA: I'm just kidding.

54:37.837 --> 54:40.449
I'm glad that you made a friend.

54:44.711 --> 54:46.823
I may have to go to Bangkok
for a night or two.

54:49.704 --> 54:51.409
Bangkok? Why?

54:51.432 --> 54:53.007
I just got to deal
with something.

54:54.504 --> 54:56.810
But why now? We just got here.

54:58.498 --> 54:59.536
Don't worry about it.

55:05.489 --> 55:06.756
So mysterious.

55:12.824 --> 55:13.977
I'm not.

55:55.647 --> 55:58.505
Could you just get him
to call me, please?

55:58.528 --> 55:59.810
He has all my numbers.

55:59.833 --> 56:01.807
ASSISTANT:<i> And may I ask</i>
<i>the reason for the call, please?</i>

56:01.830 --> 56:05.226
Because I need a lawyer
immediately, like yesterday.

56:05.249 --> 56:06.569
ASSISTANT:<i> Of course.</i>
<i>I will have him call you</i>

56:06.592 --> 56:07.684
<i>as soon as he gets out</i>
<i>of the meeting.</i>

56:07.707 --> 56:09.988
- Okay.
- ASSISTANT:<i> Okay? Thank you.</i>

56:10.011 --> 56:11.316
Okay. Thank you.

56:14.466 --> 56:16.517
Anyway, so this one time
when, you know,

56:16.540 --> 56:18.591
when the tsunami
in Phuket happened,

56:18.614 --> 56:21.624
there was this little girl,
and she had just learned

56:21.647 --> 56:23.621
about tsunamis
in her geography class,

56:23.644 --> 56:27.385
and she starts, you know,
like, screaming to everyone,

56:27.408 --> 56:29.882
"Oh my God,
there's going to be a tsunami,
there's going to be a tsunami!"

56:29.906 --> 56:31.456
But, you know, no one wanted
to believe her, but...

56:31.479 --> 56:33.608
- PIPER: Was she like...
- VICTORIA:
They didn't listen to her.

56:33.631 --> 56:36.218
LOCHLAN: Yeah, well,
so her dad comes down...
