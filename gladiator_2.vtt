by your great names

05:13.657 --> 05:15.269
to come to our aid.

05:15.423 --> 05:16.919
Defeat the Romans.

05:17.071 --> 05:18.491 line:20%
Destroy their ships,

05:18.644 --> 05:20.140 line:20%
their engines of war,

05:20.294 --> 05:22.057 line:20%
and their soldiers.

05:22.212 --> 05:25.126
We will prevail.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.636
Arishat.

05:44.151 --> 05:46.452
[faint shouting]

05:49.329 --> 05:50.672
[man] Hanno.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.578
You did not make
an offering today.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.110
I prefer to sacrifice a Roman.

[Arishat]
Where you are,

07:47.428 --> 07:50.074
Wherever they go,
they leave destruction

07:50.228 --> 07:51.876
and call it peace.

07:53.488 --> 07:56.365
This is the last free city
in Africa Nova.

07:57.324 --> 08:00.316
Today, we go into battle.

If he is not, he is no god.

Where we are,

There!

12:29.690 --> 12:30.994

I claim this city...

16:39.159 --> 16:41.115
for the glory of Rome.

16:42.840 --> 16:44.566
<i> Vae victis.</i>

16:47.174 --> 16:48.900

Woe to the conquered.

18:15.163 --> 18:17.926
[softly] Hey.
[groans]

18:18.078 --> 18:20.149
What damage have they
done you, eh?

18:20.304 --> 18:22.566
[chuckles bitterly]

18:32.423 --> 18:34.419
Lift it up. Easy, easy.
[groans]

18:34.571 --> 18:36.719
Hold that.

18:36.873 --> 18:38.177
[pained groan]

18:42.472 --> 18:43.778
Arishat?

18:46.884 --> 18:48.304
I am sorry, my son.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.251
I have not long.

18:54.516 --> 18:56.282
This galley

18:56.434 --> 18:58.621
is sailing us to something
I cannot endure.

18:58.774 --> 19:01.728
I am ready... to be taken
to another place.

19:01.881 --> 19:03.875
Stay here a while longer.
[chuckles]

19:04.029 --> 19:05.832
[light chuckle]
[pained grunt]

19:07.060 --> 19:11.470
I remember well
when you first
were brought to us.

19:11.624 --> 19:14.653
A lonely boy
from the desert.
Guileless.

19:14.807 --> 19:16.072
Afraid.

19:16.955 --> 19:20.138
You embraced everything
we taught you.

19:22.018 --> 19:26.276
You found Arishat's love.
Your soul was replenished.

19:27.388 --> 19:30.342
[chuckles]
When I die,

19:30.495 --> 19:33.410
my ancestors will meet me
in the next world.

19:35.328 --> 19:36.594
Who will meet you?

19:36.747 --> 19:38.818
Hanno,

19:38.972 --> 19:40.583
I am done.

19:40.735 --> 19:44.072
Do not let them change
what you are.

19:48.024 --> 19:49.213

[hoofbeats approaching]

20:14.297 --> 20:15.410
Have you seen this boy?

20:15.564 --> 20:18.210
[panting]

20:20.587 --> 20:22.775
Eama! Eama!

20:27.760 --> 20:30.254
[woman] You must
go alone now, Hanno.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.623
Never let them find you.

20:37.235 --> 20:39.881
[woman's breath trembling]

20:40.035 --> 20:41.913
Go. Go.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.761
[bell ringing]

21:21.459 --> 21:23.492

22:04.111 --> 22:06.796
[crowd roaring]

22:30.117 --> 22:33.338
[crowd chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

22:33.492 --> 22:34.757
Emperor Geta.

22:36.868 --> 22:38.555
Emperor Caracalla.

22:39.974 --> 22:41.355
General Acacius.

22:41.508 --> 22:44.346
I have taken Numidia
in your names

22:44.500 --> 22:46.150
that your dominion
may eclipse that

22:46.302 --> 22:48.412
of every emperor
that came before you.

22:48.566 --> 22:51.058
Crown him with laurels,
brother.

22:57.119 --> 22:59.267
[crowd cheering]

22:59.420 --> 23:02.681
[all chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

23:04.177 --> 23:05.865
[monkey hooting softly]

23:07.858 --> 23:09.815
[Geta] In honor
of your conquest,

23:10.621 --> 23:12.845
there will be games
in the Colosseum.

23:13.842 --> 23:16.183
I require no games
in my honor.

23:16.336 --> 23:19.788
Serving the Senate
and the people of Rome

23:19.941 --> 23:21.475
is honor enough for me.

23:21.629 --> 23:24.160
You are too modest,
Acacius.

23:24.314 --> 23:27.535
It does not suit a general
as accomplished as yourself.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.099
The glory is yours,
not mine.

23:32.254 --> 23:35.245
I only ask for
some respite from war

23:35.398 --> 23:36.780
to spend time
with my wife.

23:36.933 --> 23:39.120
Your wife, yes. [sniffs]

23:39.272 --> 23:40.960
Remember the privileges
we have granted her?

23:41.114 --> 23:42.149
[sword scraping]

23:42.303 --> 23:44.297
Where is she now
to ignore such an occasion?

23:44.451 --> 23:47.251
There are victories
yet still to come.

23:48.823 --> 23:50.319
Persia.

23:51.585 --> 23:52.391
India.

23:52.544 --> 23:53.503
[chuckles]

23:53.656 --> 23:57.147
Both... must be conquered.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.251
Rome has so many subjects.

24:01.404 --> 24:03.361
She must feed them.

24:04.395 --> 24:06.698
They can eat war.
[laughs]

24:09.306 --> 24:12.413
Your triumphs
will be celebrated

24:13.102 --> 24:15.596
as a tribute
to the greatness

24:16.209 --> 24:17.590
of the Roman people.

24:24.226 --> 24:27.602
[men shouting]
[horses whinnying]

25:22.182 --> 25:25.289
[screeching continues]
[loud thumping]

25:25.442 --> 25:27.015
Stay close.

25:42.779 --> 25:46.614
[announcer] Aediles
and the town councilors,

25:47.228 --> 25:49.799
distinguished guests,

25:50.758 --> 25:52.521
citizens of Antium,

25:52.675 --> 25:54.785
[jeering continues]

25:56.127 --> 25:58.467
behold the fate

25:59.656 --> 26:02.303
of the conquered enemies
of Rome:

26:03.376 --> 26:08.170
The barbarian Numidians
and their chieftain,

26:08.861 --> 26:11.585
Jugurtha!

26:11.738 --> 26:13.234
[loud thudding]

26:13.387 --> 26:15.229
[snarling]
[teeth snapping]

27:09.502 --> 27:11.611
[guttural hooting]

27:24.922 --> 27:27.529
[screeching in agony]

27:28.297 --> 27:29.563
This one is interesting.

27:29.716 --> 27:31.021

27:51.502 --> 27:53.037
[baboon choking]

27:54.264 --> 27:55.645
I'll buy him.

27:55.798 --> 27:58.023
[crowd chanting]

28:15.666 --> 28:19.003
[horse approaching]
Halt! Who goes there?

28:20.422 --> 28:21.650
General.

28:42.440 --> 28:44.893
[woman murmuring softly]

28:55.671 --> 28:57.207
My lady.

29:04.839 --> 29:07.103
I thank the gods
that brought you back home safe.

29:07.255 --> 29:10.401
Thank the Army.
They protected me.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.200
Mm.

29:14.121 --> 29:15.808
Let me feed you.

29:22.789 --> 29:24.976
[indistinct chatter]

29:25.130 --> 29:28.198
[men grunting]
[weapons clashing]

29:42.275 --> 29:43.386
[trainer] Go.

29:43.963 --> 29:45.381
To the wall.

29:55.546 --> 29:57.808
[trainer] The arena
is a sacred temple.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.382
For the bravest of you,

29:59.535 --> 30:02.220
the road to glory
runs through the arena.

30:02.373 --> 30:04.330
The arena turns slaves
into gladiators

30:04.482 --> 30:06.400
and gladiators into free men.

30:13.305 --> 30:14.878
You have worms.

30:18.522 --> 30:21.781
I know this one.
He eats monkeys.

30:21.935 --> 30:24.237
[men laughing]

30:26.883 --> 30:28.915
[indistinct chatter]

30:35.397 --> 30:37.738
[trainer] Go. Sit. Eat.

30:51.507 --> 30:53.579
[groans softly]

31:02.975 --> 31:04.625
[man hoots quietly]

31:06.159 --> 31:08.193
[men hooting]

31:10.034 --> 31:12.066
[men mimicking baboons]

31:16.707 --> 31:18.932
[hooting continues, louder]

31:26.066 --> 31:27.524
[chuckles]

31:35.847 --> 31:36.883
You.

31:38.072 --> 31:40.527
[trainer]
Hanno, get up.

31:45.896 --> 31:50.154
What is
your native language?
I speak them all.

31:53.261 --> 31:56.674
You don't answer because
you can't or because you won't?

31:58.668 --> 31:59.667
Mm, all right.

31:59.819 --> 32:03.349
Violence...
is the universal language.

32:03.502 --> 32:05.919
Viggo,
put him through his paces.

32:06.071 --> 32:10.061
He can fight an ape.
Let's see if he
can fight a man.

32:19.457 --> 32:21.223
[grunts]

32:22.182 --> 32:23.753
[Hanno groans]

32:31.541 --> 32:33.305
[Hanno exhales heavily]

32:39.480 --> 32:41.935
[both grunting]

32:55.513 --> 32:57.316
[groans heavily]

32:57.469 --> 32:59.272
[chuckling]

33:12.082 --> 33:13.424
[explosive grunt]

33:16.954 --> 33:18.143
[Macrinus]
Enough!

33:19.331 --> 33:21.979
[panting]

33:22.439 --> 33:23.627
Very good.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.389
Very good.

33:28.268 --> 33:29.650
Hose him down.

33:33.216 --> 33:34.674
Bring him to me.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.201
[grunts]

33:41.348 --> 33:42.613
Ah!

33:45.376 --> 33:47.101
A strong jaw.

33:48.790 --> 33:50.056
Good arms.

33:50.209 --> 33:51.475
[sniffs]

33:51.628 --> 33:52.778
Better smell.

33:52.932 --> 33:54.888
[chuckles lightly]

33:55.770 --> 33:57.343
You will do well.

33:58.033 --> 33:59.683
It is an art,

33:59.836 --> 34:01.754
choosing gladiators.

34:03.020 --> 34:05.091
Some choose entertainers.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.238
Some choose brute force.

34:07.392 --> 34:08.850
I choose rage.

34:09.463 --> 34:11.112
[Macrinus chuckles]

34:13.069 --> 34:14.296
Crowd loves blood.

34:14.449 --> 34:16.213
And they love those who
love blood as much as they do.

34:16.367 --> 34:18.823
And you, my friend, rage

34:19.398 --> 34:21.660
pours out of you like...

34:23.002 --> 34:24.537
like milk...

34:25.956 --> 34:27.337
from a whore's tit.

34:28.181 --> 34:29.869
You will be
quite the fighter.

34:30.023 --> 34:31.288
Not for you.

34:31.442 --> 34:33.360
You're right,
you do not fight for me.

34:33.512 --> 34:35.814
I put you in the ring,
you fight or you die.

34:35.967 --> 34:36.964
The choice is yours.

34:37.118 --> 34:39.879
But whose head
could I give you

34:40.034 --> 34:43.486
that would satisfy this fury?

34:43.638 --> 34:45.441
The entire Roman Army's.

34:45.594 --> 34:47.666
[hearty laugh]

34:48.931 --> 34:49.928
Too much.

34:50.083 --> 34:51.502
Mm.

34:51.654 --> 34:53.611
The general will do.

34:53.764 --> 34:54.723
General?

34:55.951 --> 34:57.983
General Acacius?
Mm.

35:00.055 --> 35:02.317
Use your rage
in my service,

35:02.472 --> 35:06.423
and you will have his head
ready for your sword.

35:07.420 --> 35:10.526
Serve me and I will serve you.
Deny me...

35:11.754 --> 35:14.055
and you will die.

35:14.208 --> 35:16.088
[thunder rumbles
in distance]

35:16.932 --> 35:18.619
There are times I wished
you'd abandoned me

35:18.773 --> 35:20.460
rather than
fight their wars.

35:20.613 --> 35:22.609
I've made my choice.

35:24.449 --> 35:26.367
I can live with it.

35:30.087 --> 35:33.118
But my patience with those two
is at an end.

35:35.802 --> 35:37.568
Leta?

35:37.720 --> 35:41.365
You may go
to your quarters now.
We need nothing more.

35:48.001 --> 35:49.573
To hear wives and mothers
mourning their dead

35:49.726 --> 35:51.529
on that beach at Numidia...

35:53.869 --> 35:55.517
Lucilla.

36:00.389 --> 36:01.846
No more.

36:04.071 --> 36:05.874
I will not waste

36:06.027 --> 36:09.633
another generation
of young men for their vanity.

36:11.474 --> 36:15.156
If I fight another campaign,
it must be to depose them.

36:16.844 --> 36:18.953
When will your troops
arrive?

36:19.644 --> 36:21.716
They land at Ostia
in ten days.

36:21.868 --> 36:25.896
How many of them will be
loyal to you alone?

36:27.431 --> 36:28.850
All of them.

36:30.575 --> 36:33.989
The emperors do not have
the support of the people.

36:34.143 --> 36:38.899
The people are weary
of the madness, the tyranny.

36:40.242 --> 36:41.506
[sighs]

36:41.660 --> 36:45.764
What is the dream of Rome
if her people are not free?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.334
[chuckles softly]

36:51.748 --> 36:53.359
[whimpers]

36:55.315 --> 36:58.154
[excited chatter]

37:03.946 --> 37:05.710
[laughing]

37:07.091 --> 37:09.546
[man] Enjoy yourself,
everyone,

37:09.699 --> 37:11.425
to excess!

37:11.578 --> 37:14.302
Thank you. Thank you.

37:14.455 --> 37:17.561
[castrato singing
to lively music]

37:26.000 --> 37:27.228
Oh!

37:27.841 --> 37:30.718
[laughs] Please, drink.

37:30.871 --> 37:33.709
Ah! Excuse me. Macrinus!

37:34.783 --> 37:37.238
I knew the provinces
were not enough for you.

37:37.392 --> 37:40.421
I'm just here
for the games.
Ah, well,

37:40.575 --> 37:41.994
you won't be disappointed.

37:42.148 --> 37:45.216
Rome has all the games
that men like you like to play.

37:45.369 --> 37:47.325
Men like me, Thraex?
Men like us.

37:47.480 --> 37:50.969
I know nothing happens
in Rome unless you've
tasted it first.

37:51.123 --> 37:52.811
[both laughing]

38:06.925 --> 38:08.306
What is my purpose here?

38:08.461 --> 38:09.995
You'll find out soon enough.

38:14.175 --> 38:16.170
What's this we hear
about you being interested

38:16.324 --> 38:19.967
in standing for election
to the Senate, Macrinus?

38:20.121 --> 38:22.345
Me? No, I'm, uh...

38:22.499 --> 38:24.954
I don't even know how
to use an abacus.

38:25.106 --> 38:26.871
But I do understand that

38:27.869 --> 38:29.057
it's customary
for your guests

38:29.211 --> 38:31.666
to make wagers
at these affairs?

38:31.818 --> 38:34.120
How large a sum
did you have in mind?

38:35.577 --> 38:37.035
A thousand gold denarii?

38:37.188 --> 38:38.454
Two.

38:40.296 --> 38:41.484
Two?

38:43.249 --> 38:45.551
Denarii.
[chuckles]

38:48.503 --> 38:49.462
[sighs deeply]

38:49.616 --> 38:51.611
[knife scraping]

39:00.701 --> 39:03.424
Stand back! Stand back!

39:04.958 --> 39:06.148
My emperors.

39:06.301 --> 39:10.213
Lords, ladies and gentlemen,
and senators.

39:10.367 --> 39:12.707
For your entertainment,

39:13.282 --> 39:15.429
the art of combat!

39:15.584 --> 39:17.386
[crowd murmurs, clapping]

39:17.540 --> 39:19.113
[Thraex] May I present

39:19.265 --> 39:21.106
the barbarian versus,

39:21.259 --> 39:25.249
from my own stable,
the mighty Vichek!

39:25.403 --> 39:27.435
[applause, cheers]

39:32.191 --> 39:34.839
This is your gladiator?
It is.

39:38.021 --> 39:40.515
[Thraex] Three rounds,
hand to hand.

39:40.669 --> 39:42.011
Swords!

39:42.165 --> 39:45.502
We want swords.
A fight to the death.

39:46.575 --> 39:49.413
No quarter to be offered...
or given.

39:49.566 --> 39:51.715
Fight now!
[swords scraping]

39:56.893 --> 39:57.967
Brother,

39:58.888 --> 40:00.652
let's not kill each other
for their amusement.

40:00.806 --> 40:02.032
[Vichek yells, grunts]

40:02.186 --> 40:04.526
[excited murmuring]

40:04.680 --> 40:06.444
[both yell, grunt]

40:15.611 --> 40:16.532
[cackling]

40:16.685 --> 40:19.139
[both yelling]

40:31.529 --> 40:33.255
[Vichek panting]

40:35.594 --> 40:37.473
[yells]

40:39.928 --> 40:41.846
[sword clattering]

40:42.997 --> 40:44.646
[scattered cheers, applause]

40:49.748 --> 40:51.474
[Hanno groans]

40:58.914 --> 41:01.216
[scattered cheers]

41:01.369 --> 41:02.981
[applause]

41:04.284 --> 41:05.896
[Geta] Remarkable!

41:06.471 --> 41:08.081
[giggling]

41:08.235 --> 41:09.770
Remarkable!

41:10.729 --> 41:12.876
Thraex,
he looked expensive.
[dry chuckle]

41:13.988 --> 41:16.289
Congratulations.
Thank you.

41:17.096 --> 41:18.515
Remarkable.

41:22.734 --> 41:24.344
From where do you hail?

41:29.830 --> 41:31.057
Speak.

41:34.509 --> 41:35.467
I said speak.

41:35.622 --> 41:37.194
He is from the colonies,
Your Majesty.

41:37.347 --> 41:39.802
His native tongue
is all he understands.

41:45.825 --> 41:48.892
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

41:50.159 --> 41:55.221
Smooth is the descent,
and easy is the way.

41:57.792 --> 42:00.093
[laughing] But...

42:02.164 --> 42:03.929
to come back from hell

42:04.082 --> 42:05.692
and view the cheerful skies,

42:05.846 --> 42:10.410
in this the task
and mighty labor lies."

42:11.255 --> 42:13.940
[panting]

42:16.585 --> 42:17.967
Virgil, Your Majesty.

42:18.926 --> 42:19.923
[Caracalla] Poetry!

42:20.076 --> 42:22.032
[laughter]

42:23.107 --> 42:25.752
Very clever, Macrinus.
Thank you.

42:26.788 --> 42:29.014
I've grown so bored,
but you surprise me.

42:29.166 --> 42:32.043
To amuse you is my only wish.

42:32.197 --> 42:34.077
We are amused,
we are amused.

42:35.955 --> 42:37.259
We are amused.

42:38.411 --> 42:41.632
And we all look forward
to seeing your poet

42:42.552 --> 42:43.742
perform in the arena.

42:43.896 --> 42:46.810
As do I, Your Majesties.

42:47.501 --> 42:48.575
Thank you.

42:49.151 --> 42:50.033
Viggo?

42:51.259 --> 42:52.717
[Viggo] Come with me.

43:09.862 --> 43:12.471
You fought well today,
but you were lucky, too.

43:14.656 --> 43:16.805
The lines you recited.

43:16.959 --> 43:19.604
You didn't learn that
in Africa, I know that.

43:20.371 --> 43:22.443
A good verse travels far.
Mm.

43:22.597 --> 43:24.360
Who taught you poetry?

43:24.515 --> 43:26.471
A captured Roman officer.

43:26.623 --> 43:29.808
I was posted guard over him
and he used to tell us tales

43:29.960 --> 43:31.803
to pass the time.

43:32.570 --> 43:33.834
And what became
of this prisoner?

43:33.988 --> 43:35.446
Oh, we ate him.

43:36.673 --> 43:37.556
As barbarians do.

43:37.708 --> 43:39.934
[chuckling]
As barbarians do.

43:40.086 --> 43:41.813
And where were you born?

43:41.966 --> 43:44.230
Why does my past matter
if it is my future

43:44.382 --> 43:46.570
to die for you in the arena?

43:52.860 --> 43:55.084
Tell me what use have I
for Roman money.

43:58.116 --> 43:59.688
A gladiator

44:00.456 --> 44:02.258
can buy his own freedom.

44:03.102 --> 44:05.020
His liberty.
[chuckles]

44:05.826 --> 44:07.284
The Roman dream.

44:07.437 --> 44:09.393
No, the slave dreams
not of freedom

44:09.548 --> 44:12.003
but of a slave
to call his own.

44:12.807 --> 44:14.265
Cicero.

44:15.224 --> 44:17.680
Is that what you were
raised on, Macrinus?

44:19.138 --> 44:21.784
What did you have to do
for Roman money?

44:22.936 --> 44:24.201
You promised me a head.

44:24.355 --> 44:27.309
Earn your keep
and you can have
anyone's head.

44:35.633 --> 44:37.206
[stone scraping]

44:37.360 --> 44:39.124
[door unlatches, opens]

44:45.799 --> 44:47.295
[thunder rumbling]

44:50.442 --> 44:52.090
[Lucilla] Father,

44:52.245 --> 44:54.738
protect us and guide us.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.353
Senators.

45:09.930 --> 45:11.118
My lady.

45:16.682 --> 45:20.287
My lady, I wish we were
meeting in better times.

45:20.978 --> 45:23.050
Better times will come.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.310
And why are we here?

45:26.463 --> 45:28.458
[Acacius]
To take back the city.

45:29.992 --> 45:33.638
And restore Rome
to where she should be.

45:34.942 --> 45:36.822
An exciting venture.

45:37.819 --> 45:40.351
When?
On the final day
of the games.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.726
My army waits for my command
at Ostia.

45:43.879 --> 45:46.642
Five thousand soldiers
loyal to me...

45:47.908 --> 45:50.133
will enter Rome
and then the Colosseum,

45:50.287 --> 45:52.051
where they will
arrest the emperors

45:52.205 --> 45:53.930
for their crimes
against the Senate

45:54.660 --> 45:56.156
and their people.

45:56.962 --> 46:01.680
Uh, this plan
is ambitious and risky.

46:01.834 --> 46:04.328
Rome will be yours
to administer and to--

46:04.480 --> 46:08.931
Marcus Aurelius talked
of restoring power
to the Senate,

46:09.084 --> 46:13.266
but that was a generation ago.
Much has changed.

46:13.419 --> 46:17.179
The people
have not seen hope

46:17.331 --> 46:18.444
for many years.

46:18.598 --> 46:22.127
But with time...
and guidance...

46:22.280 --> 46:23.509
[sighs sharply]

46:23.661 --> 46:26.960
Lucilla, you are the daughter
of Marcus Aurelius.

46:27.115 --> 46:29.225
He had my loyalty.

46:30.797 --> 46:32.791
And so do you.

46:34.902 --> 46:36.360
Senator Thraex?

46:37.894 --> 46:41.308
Politics follows power,
my lady.

46:42.191 --> 46:45.297
Take back
what is rightfully yours...

46:46.141 --> 46:48.214
and the Senate
will support you.

46:49.173 --> 46:50.400
Thank you.

47:05.821 --> 47:07.202
Food! Food!

47:11.499 --> 47:13.725
When I was told of this place,

47:13.877 --> 47:16.142
they never mentioned
the stink.

47:17.945 --> 47:19.057
That would be Hanno.

47:19.210 --> 47:21.973
[laughter]

47:22.125 --> 47:24.926
Well, you'll have to
put up with me as I am.

47:25.079 --> 47:26.537
[laughing]

47:29.836 --> 47:33.021
And what's that up there?
A wolf?

47:34.479 --> 47:37.625
The twins there,
they were outcasts.

47:37.778 --> 47:39.503
Left in the hills to die.

47:40.694 --> 47:44.376
That wolf found them
and she suckled them
on her milk.

47:45.412 --> 47:47.714
Raised by an animal.
It's in their blood.

47:47.867 --> 47:50.706
How do you know this place?

47:51.665 --> 47:53.736
I know the chaos
they brought.

47:54.733 --> 47:57.343
This city infects
everything it touches.

47:57.496 --> 47:59.490
I never dreamt
it would be so big.

47:59.644 --> 48:01.256
Don't fall for it.

48:01.408 --> 48:03.441
This city is diseased.

48:04.632 --> 48:06.779
[peasants] Food! Food!

48:09.005 --> 48:11.497
[children chattering]

48:14.145 --> 48:15.410
[elephant trumpeting]

48:15.565 --> 48:17.712
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

48:29.414 --> 48:31.907
[man] You! Barbarian scum!

48:33.019 --> 48:35.321
[grunts]
[people yelling]

48:37.430 --> 48:39.503
[woman] Help me.
Please, help me!

48:41.421 --> 48:43.493
[all pleading]

48:46.216 --> 48:48.364
[horses whinnying]

48:55.884 --> 48:57.878
[crows squawking]

49:14.681 --> 49:15.985
Ah!
Thraex.

49:19.590 --> 49:20.511
About our wager.

49:20.665 --> 49:22.084
Ah. The barbarian.

49:22.238 --> 49:23.581
Yes, I haven't forgotten,
I always repay my debts.

49:23.735 --> 49:25.383
I was merely
going to suggest

49:25.538 --> 49:27.378
that perhaps your luck
might change.

49:27.532 --> 49:29.988
Shall we say
double or quits?

49:34.246 --> 49:35.320
Ah.
Ah.

49:35.472 --> 49:37.429
[both laughing]

49:41.764 --> 49:44.104
[people shouting, indistinct]

49:47.174 --> 49:48.593
[man] Get back!

50:02.174 --> 50:03.745
Fresh meat.

50:07.543 --> 50:09.423
Line up! Line up!

50:22.774 --> 50:24.961
[faint crowd cheering]

50:26.994 --> 50:29.563
[cheering continues, louder]

50:38.694 --> 50:41.265
Play! Play!

50:41.840 --> 50:45.139
[playing simple fanfare]

50:55.727 --> 50:58.067
Emperor Caracalla.

50:58.643 --> 51:00.368
Emperor Geta.

51:00.523 --> 51:03.016
Citizens of Rome!

51:03.169 --> 51:04.819
[crowd cheering]

51:04.973 --> 51:07.735
These sacred games

51:07.887 --> 51:10.956
are held to honor
the victory of Rome

51:11.111 --> 51:14.064
over the barbarians of Numidia.

51:14.217 --> 51:15.253
[crowd booing]

51:15.407 --> 51:17.901
Go! Go!

51:20.393 --> 51:23.808
[announcer] And to honor
Rome's legionary commander,

51:23.962 --> 51:25.957
General Justus Acacius!

51:26.109 --> 51:28.680
[crowd cheering]
[man] Long live Acacius!

51:28.834 --> 51:30.022
[announcer] And with him

51:30.177 --> 51:34.779
Lucilla, the daughter
of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

51:34.933 --> 51:36.275
[crowd cheering]

51:36.430 --> 51:40.035
[woman, faintly] Lucilla!
[man] Mother of Rome!

51:40.841 --> 51:42.222
Acacius.

51:42.759 --> 51:43.871
General.

51:48.858 --> 51:50.854
[crowd roars]

51:51.007 --> 51:54.230
[chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

51:54.383 --> 51:59.331
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

52:00.175 --> 52:01.020
Speak to them.

52:01.172 --> 52:03.666
[man faintly]
Speak to us!

52:08.769 --> 52:11.300
[cheering ebbs]

52:11.454 --> 52:14.100
I am not an orator

52:14.254 --> 52:15.828
or a politician.

52:16.978 --> 52:18.628
I am a soldier.

52:20.738 --> 52:25.955
I have seen bravery
in men and women during war.

52:26.568 --> 52:28.411
And even once in this arena.

52:29.715 --> 52:31.556
So if you ask anything
of the gods...

52:33.243 --> 52:35.660
ask for that same bravery.

52:37.732 --> 52:39.881
Because Rome needs it now.

52:40.686 --> 52:42.834
[applause, cheers swelling]

52:43.640 --> 52:46.402
[crowd chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

52:46.556 --> 52:49.739
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

52:51.580 --> 52:53.615
[chanting continues]

53:01.670 --> 53:03.933
[announcer]
From the South Gate,

53:04.087 --> 53:09.190
fighters from the stable
of Macrinus of Thysdrus!

53:21.120 --> 53:22.846
From the stables

53:23.000 --> 53:26.453
of Emperors Caracalla
and Geta themselves,

53:26.605 --> 53:29.022
the undefeated champion:

53:29.176 --> 53:32.667
Glyceo the Destroyer!

53:32.820 --> 53:34.623
[crowd roars]

53:39.111 --> 53:39.917
Hold.

53:40.070 --> 53:41.950
[growling]

53:46.285 --> 53:48.088
[grunting]

53:52.769 --> 53:55.071
[roaring cheers]

53:58.447 --> 54:00.556
[rhino roaring]

54:01.899 --> 54:03.741
[Hanno] Hold.

54:04.891 --> 54:06.541
Hail Caesars!

54:07.883 --> 54:11.182
[crowd chanting]
Glyceo! Glyceo! Glyceo!

54:11.337 --> 54:13.370
[chanting continues]

54:17.474 --> 54:20.236
[rhino roars]

54:22.269 --> 54:25.453
Hold together
and when it charges,
break for the wall.

54:25.606 --> 54:26.527
[man] Why should I?

54:30.556 --> 54:31.477
[Hanno] Hold!

54:32.551 --> 54:33.510
Hold!

54:33.662 --> 54:34.583
Break!

54:35.581 --> 54:36.847
Cowards!

54:39.071 --> 54:40.262
[yells]

54:41.259 --> 54:42.793
[groaning]

54:45.670 --> 54:47.013
[yells]
[axe clattering]

54:48.202 --> 54:50.120
[huffing]

54:50.274 --> 54:52.345
To the wall!

54:53.304 --> 54:54.532
[grunts heavily]

54:56.143 --> 54:57.525
[rhino groaning loudly]

54:57.677 --> 54:59.135
[grunts]

55:03.778 --> 55:04.698
Come on!

55:04.851 --> 55:06.079
[roars]

55:10.529 --> 55:12.333
[grunts]

55:12.793 --> 55:14.136
[screaming]

55:14.289 --> 55:17.205
[cheering]

55:17.357 --> 55:18.738
[giggling]

55:53.610 --> 55:55.874
[guttural roaring]

56:16.091 --> 56:18.660
[rhino bellowing]

56:20.118 --> 56:21.807
[excited cheering]

56:22.458 --> 56:24.645
[rhino groaning]

56:31.243 --> 56:32.433
[gasps]

56:34.120 --> 56:35.578
[both grunting]

56:42.636 --> 56:43.557
[roaring]

56:43.711 --> 56:46.704
Brother, it's that poet,
is it not?

56:47.356 --> 56:49.197
I can't remember.

56:49.350 --> 56:51.115
That night was a blur.

56:52.227 --> 56:54.759
"The gates of hell
are open night and day.

56:54.913 --> 56:57.829
Smooth the desc--"
I forget.

56:57.981 --> 56:59.785
"Smooth the descent..."

57:00.475 --> 57:02.431
"Smooth is the descent,

57:02.969 --> 57:04.695
easy is the way."

57:12.060 --> 57:13.059
Shield!

57:39.567 --> 57:41.025
[yelling]

57:47.585 --> 57:51.152
[crowd chanting]
Mercy! Mercy! Mercy!

57:52.879 --> 57:54.067
Blood.

57:56.944 --> 57:58.057
Lucilla,

57:58.633 --> 57:59.860
shall we show mercy?

58:00.013 --> 58:01.625
Mercy.

58:03.582 --> 58:05.614
[chanting continues]

58:16.279 --> 58:18.006
No mercy!

58:18.158 --> 58:19.809
Your life has been
spared by the gods--

58:19.961 --> 58:24.106
I would sooner face your blade
than accept Roman mercy!

58:29.092 --> 58:31.163
[both grunting]

58:33.351 --> 58:34.424
[attacking yell]

58:34.578 --> 58:35.383
[grunts]

58:35.537 --> 58:37.954
[crowd roaring]

58:39.374 --> 58:42.634
[chanting]
Kill! Kill! Kill!

58:42.788 --> 58:45.933
Kill! Kill! Kill!

58:50.614 --> 58:52.954
[yelling]

58:56.406 --> 59:01.432
[crowd chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

59:05.996 --> 59:09.410
[cheering intensifies]

59:12.979 --> 59:14.437
[rhino groaning]

59:28.054 --> 59:30.932
The road to freedom
doesn't run
through the arena.

59:31.584 --> 59:33.196
It leads to this.

59:37.377 --> 59:39.334
Go to your cells.

59:41.481 --> 59:42.787
[all cheering, clapping]

59:42.939 --> 59:46.468
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

59:48.732 --> 59:50.536
[panting]

59:59.052 --> 01:00:00.816
[dog whimpers]

01:00:02.543 --> 01:00:04.000
Come on, let's go.

01:00:16.468 --> 01:00:19.691
"Gates of hell
are open night and day.

01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:22.108
[voice wavering]
Smooth is the descent...

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:24.255
[crying]
...easy is the way."

01:00:27.976 --> 01:00:30.317
[boy]
<i> There, there, there, there.</i>

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:31.583
<i> And I've got you.</i>

01:00:31.737 --> 01:00:34.461
<i> I'm Maximus,</i>
<i> the savior of Rome!</i>

01:00:53.104 --> 01:00:55.176
Scatto and Argento.

01:00:57.171 --> 01:00:59.895
[people cheer, echoing]

01:01:03.116 --> 01:01:04.882
[gasping softly]

01:01:08.219 --> 01:01:09.677
Lucius is safe?

01:01:26.632 --> 01:01:27.784
[Lucilla] Lucius!

01:01:37.642 --> 01:01:39.178
[horse whinnies]

01:01:39.868 --> 01:01:41.517
[Lucilla] Lucius,

01:01:41.671 --> 01:01:44.701
you're the sole heir
to the throne now.

01:01:46.197 --> 01:01:47.464
There are men
who want to kill you

01:01:47.616 --> 01:01:49.151
so they can take power.

01:01:50.455 --> 01:01:53.602
I promise I'll bring you back
as soon as it's safe.

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:57.131
Mother, why can't you
come with me?

01:01:57.284 --> 01:01:59.585
[crying] I... I have to
stay here for your sake.

01:01:59.739 --> 01:02:01.657
[sniffles]
And for the sake of Rome.

01:02:01.811 --> 01:02:04.152
Remember who you are.

01:02:04.305 --> 01:02:06.223
And that I love you.

01:02:06.836 --> 01:02:08.217
I love you.

01:02:09.024 --> 01:02:10.098
[man] Come.

01:02:13.127 --> 01:02:14.547
Give me your leg.

01:02:16.236 --> 01:02:17.846
Go. Go!

01:02:17.999 --> 01:02:19.380
[horse whinnies]

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:25.826
[doctor] So...

01:02:27.014 --> 01:02:28.320
[Hanno grunts]

01:02:28.856 --> 01:02:30.390
What's your name?

01:02:31.926 --> 01:02:32.769
[exhales]

01:02:32.923 --> 01:02:35.531
I'm Ravi. I'm a doctor.

01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:39.904
Because... more men die
of infected wounds

01:02:40.058 --> 01:02:42.591
than out there, in the arena.

01:02:43.702 --> 01:02:46.465
This needs to be cleaned,
it needs to be stitched and

01:02:46.618 --> 01:02:49.266
[exclaims softly]
it is going to hurt.

01:02:49.419 --> 01:02:50.301
Mm.

01:02:50.454 --> 01:02:53.562
This is Devil's Breath
and opium.

01:02:54.099 --> 01:02:55.671
It's for the pain.

01:02:56.478 --> 01:02:58.241
You should breathe in.

01:02:59.278 --> 01:03:00.198
[inhales sharply,
grunts]

01:03:00.352 --> 01:03:02.347
[deep inhale]

01:03:03.766 --> 01:03:05.186
[Ravi] I've been here
so long now,

01:03:05.338 --> 01:03:07.564
I don't even notice anymore.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:10.518
I've done more amputations
than I can count.

01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:14.008
Where'd you
learn your trade?
Why do you ask?

01:03:14.163 --> 01:03:15.926
You've got a heavy hand.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.536
I used to be
a gladiator myself.

01:03:18.688 --> 01:03:19.763
Ah.

01:03:19.917 --> 01:03:21.989
And would you have bested me?
[Ravi chuckles]

01:03:22.141 --> 01:03:23.676
In your prime, of course.

01:03:24.596 --> 01:03:27.283
In your current state,
I could best you now.

01:03:27.435 --> 01:03:28.702
[laughs]

01:03:28.854 --> 01:03:32.001
Luckily for you,
I have put down my sword.

01:03:32.154 --> 01:03:34.148
So now I spend my days
[groaning]

01:03:34.303 --> 01:03:36.835
saving lives
instead of taking them.

01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:38.061
[inhales, grunts]

01:03:38.216 --> 01:03:40.823
And why such a change
so late in life?

01:03:41.553 --> 01:03:43.587
What we do in life

01:03:43.739 --> 01:03:46.079
echoes in eternity.

01:03:46.233 --> 01:03:48.074
[panting softly]

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.028
I feel like
I know those words.

01:03:51.182 --> 01:03:53.561
[Ravi chuckles]
I can't take credit.

01:03:53.713 --> 01:03:56.168
It's written on
one of the tombs.

01:03:56.323 --> 01:03:58.700
Over the bones of a gladiator.

01:03:58.855 --> 01:04:00.197
[sharp grunt of pain]
[Macrinus] My champion!

01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:02.460
I smell Devil's Breath!

01:04:02.614 --> 01:04:04.686
[laughing]

01:04:04.838 --> 01:04:08.137
My... champion.

01:04:08.944 --> 01:04:10.747
Did you hear that crowd?

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:15.734
Did you hear that crowd?
Mm-hm.

01:04:16.962 --> 01:04:19.417
You have something.
I knew it from the start.

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:23.521
Did you now?
Yes. The Greeks call it...

01:04:24.212 --> 01:04:25.632
<i>thymos.</i>

01:04:25.785 --> 01:04:27.128
Smoke.

01:04:27.741 --> 01:04:29.123
Rage.

01:04:29.928 --> 01:04:32.000
That rage is your gift.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:35.222
Like the great Achilles.

01:04:35.376 --> 01:04:37.485
Never let it go.

01:04:37.639 --> 01:04:40.400
It will carry you
to greatness,

01:04:40.554 --> 01:04:42.358
my champion.

01:04:50.145 --> 01:04:53.137
[horses whinny, snort]

01:05:00.924 --> 01:05:02.804
Thank you

01:05:02.957 --> 01:05:04.760
for inviting me.

01:05:04.915 --> 01:05:06.948
This is truly an honor.

01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:13.507
I hear you are
the talk of the court.

01:05:13.661 --> 01:05:15.004
[kissing hand]

01:05:15.847 --> 01:05:16.884
Yes.

01:05:17.574 --> 01:05:19.069
We've met before.

01:05:19.683 --> 01:05:21.756
Have we?
Long ago.

01:05:23.097 --> 01:05:24.402
Where?

01:05:24.556 --> 01:05:26.396
I was in the service
of your father's army

01:05:26.551 --> 01:05:28.622
on his African campaign.

01:05:29.657 --> 01:05:31.767
You served
with my father?

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:33.916
[groaning]

01:05:35.259 --> 01:05:36.332
Mm.

01:05:36.909 --> 01:05:38.980
I had the privilege

01:05:39.786 --> 01:05:41.396
of reading
his "Meditations."

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:42.778
Mm.

01:05:45.502 --> 01:05:47.458
"The best revenge

01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:51.716
is to be unlike him
who performed the injury."

01:05:53.634 --> 01:05:56.090
I hear you've been
arming half the legions

01:05:56.243 --> 01:06:01.230
in the entire empire,
and here, now, in Rome...

01:06:02.265 --> 01:06:05.104
you're gaining influence
by sponsoring gladiators.

01:06:05.257 --> 01:06:07.176
I do it for the love
of the sport.

01:06:07.329 --> 01:06:10.361
And where did you find
these gladiators?

01:06:11.127 --> 01:06:13.966
They're usually
prisoners of war.

01:06:14.733 --> 01:06:17.994
Or vagrants.
Why do you ask?

01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:20.949
A man can choose to fight...

01:06:22.674 --> 01:06:23.979
and stay alive.

01:06:24.133 --> 01:06:27.431
It's the same in life as it is
in the arena, is it not?

01:06:29.695 --> 01:06:31.152
Who is this?

01:06:31.305 --> 01:06:33.762
That is my father
as a youth.

01:06:36.639 --> 01:06:37.865
[Macrinus]
<i> She had a child?</i>

01:06:38.019 --> 01:06:39.439
Mm. [swallows]

01:06:39.593 --> 01:06:42.009
It's common knowledge.
When Commodus was killed,

01:06:42.163 --> 01:06:43.735
the boy disappeared.
Mm.

01:06:43.888 --> 01:06:45.884
But who would care?
Lucilla would care.

01:06:46.037 --> 01:06:48.723
More wine!
More wine!

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:53.364
He was of the royal bloodline,
after all.

01:06:54.899 --> 01:06:56.049
And his father?

01:06:56.203 --> 01:07:00.692
[senator] Ostensibly,
Lucius Verus.

01:07:00.844 --> 01:07:02.572
See, it was
an arranged marriage.

01:07:02.724 --> 01:07:03.606
She was 14.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.906
Mm.
Females were not his taste.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.402
Nor mine, some days.
Nor yours!

01:07:08.555 --> 01:07:09.706
[both laugh]

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.888
No, no, no.
By rumor, you see,
she took lovers.

01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:18.222
And by rumor,
the real father...
was Commodus.

01:07:18.989 --> 01:07:21.407
Brotherly love,
you see?
Yeah.

01:07:21.561 --> 01:07:23.249
If he died,

01:07:24.015 --> 01:07:26.279
there has to be remains.
Mm.

01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:29.616
And if he lived,
that would make him about...

01:07:29.769 --> 01:07:31.649
Um, well,
let's work it out.

01:07:31.802 --> 01:07:35.064
He was about 12
when he died?
Yes.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:39.474
So that would make him...

01:07:41.662 --> 01:07:44.155
[heavy door rumbling]

01:07:47.416 --> 01:07:49.488
[squeaking]

01:07:56.430 --> 01:07:58.502
[hoofbeats thudding]

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.461
My lady.

01:08:14.997 --> 01:08:15.918
Gracchus.

01:08:16.877 --> 01:08:18.795
Please come.
Thank you.

01:08:36.748 --> 01:08:38.168
Gladiator...

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:40.546
do you know me?

01:08:48.525 --> 01:08:49.907
Do you have a family?

01:08:52.246 --> 01:08:55.431
A wife. Arishat.

01:08:56.888 --> 01:08:57.962
Arishat.

01:08:58.115 --> 01:09:01.492
She was killed
under your husband's command.

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:05.826
[sighing] Rome drowns
in its own blood.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:08.473
And yet you enjoy
the pleasures of the Colosseum.

01:09:09.509 --> 01:09:12.463
There is much
you do not understand.

01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:19.790
Lucius.

01:09:19.943 --> 01:09:21.900
I do not know
who you think I am.

01:09:22.053 --> 01:09:23.588
[Lucilla's breath trembles]

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:25.889
My name is Hanno,

01:09:26.044 --> 01:09:28.651
and I have no mother,
or none that I can remember.

01:09:31.605 --> 01:09:33.102
[sniffles]

01:09:34.943 --> 01:09:36.670
[crying] I'm so sorry.

01:09:36.823 --> 01:09:38.970
If your son were here,
I feel sure he would tell you

01:09:39.124 --> 01:09:40.736
not to grieve him.

01:09:40.888 --> 01:09:42.654
For he would not be the boy
that you sent away.

01:09:42.807 --> 01:09:44.801
That boy is dead.

01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:49.099
You may think
I have little worth.

01:09:50.517 --> 01:09:52.627
You may think
I betrayed you.

01:09:54.392 --> 01:09:56.233
But I need you to know...

01:09:57.346 --> 01:10:00.146
if you will not have
your mother's love,

01:10:00.299 --> 01:10:03.253
then take
your father's strength.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.748
You need it.

01:10:07.741 --> 01:10:12.000
His name was
Maximus Decimus Meridius.

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:14.647
And I see him in you.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.144
Get out.

01:10:17.985 --> 01:10:20.554
[Gracchus]
My lady, we must go at once!

01:10:21.168 --> 01:10:22.665
[Lucilla sobs]

01:10:23.739 --> 01:10:25.963
Lucius, you were loved

01:10:26.117 --> 01:10:29.186
by myself
and by your father.

01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.106
[sniffles]

01:10:30.261 --> 01:10:31.756
Your name
was on his lips--

01:10:31.909 --> 01:10:33.674
Get out!

01:10:38.317 --> 01:10:39.466
[panting]

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.500
[door shuts]

01:10:50.284 --> 01:10:51.781
[Lucilla exhales]

01:10:58.533 --> 01:11:00.488
Lucius is alive.

01:11:02.637 --> 01:11:04.363
Are you certain?

01:11:04.516 --> 01:11:05.783
Yes.

01:11:06.626 --> 01:11:08.008
I know my son.

01:11:10.809 --> 01:11:12.727
I spoke to him
tonight.

01:11:15.757 --> 01:11:18.902
He may be lost to me
for what I did,

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:21.702
but he lives.

01:11:22.661 --> 01:11:25.156
The third day of the games
is tomorrow.

01:11:25.309 --> 01:11:26.882
Most fighters won't survive.

01:11:27.036 --> 01:11:28.377
Acacius,

01:11:29.643 --> 01:11:31.140
you must help him.

01:11:31.869 --> 01:11:33.749
Help him?
[crying] Yes.

01:11:36.088 --> 01:11:38.544
I failed him then.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.539
I know I did.

01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:44.298
I cannot fail him now.

01:11:46.714 --> 01:11:48.019
The army is in Ostia.

01:11:48.173 --> 01:11:50.780
If we wait a few days...

01:11:50.935 --> 01:11:53.045
He could be dead
by then.

01:11:54.963 --> 01:11:55.998
Acacius,

01:11:56.151 --> 01:11:59.835
I would willingly
give my life for Rome,

01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.287
but I will not
give my son's.

01:12:09.156 --> 01:12:11.381
[Viggo] And one.

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:13.682
And two.

01:12:13.837 --> 01:12:16.367
And one.
[all groaning with effort]

01:12:16.521 --> 01:12:19.436
Together.
Timing, timing, timing!

01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:23.580
And one. And two.

01:12:24.193 --> 01:12:25.958
And one.

01:12:26.111 --> 01:12:28.029
Pause, pause!

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.827
We won't get far
like this.

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.362
[all laughing]

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:35.778
Just him. You go.

01:12:35.933 --> 01:12:37.275
Go!

01:12:37.428 --> 01:12:41.073
Let's see how far you can go
on your own without your team.

01:12:42.646 --> 01:12:44.027
Ready?

01:12:44.179 --> 01:12:45.445
One!

01:12:46.213 --> 01:12:47.018
And two!

01:12:47.172 --> 01:12:49.282
Timing, timing!

01:12:49.857 --> 01:12:51.277
Come on, more!

01:12:52.543 --> 01:12:53.502
[grunts]

01:12:56.264 --> 01:12:57.836
[Viggo] More!

01:13:05.202 --> 01:13:07.235
[Lucius groans loudly]

01:13:10.112 --> 01:13:11.915
[heavy grunt]

01:13:13.986 --> 01:13:14.984
Leave him.

01:13:15.137 --> 01:13:17.248
[indistinct chatter]

01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:20.048
[huffs, grunts]

01:13:29.792 --> 01:13:31.057
[cork pops]

01:13:33.052 --> 01:13:36.582
[stammering]
It's just vinegar,
my friend.

01:13:37.233 --> 01:13:38.154
[pained groan]

01:13:38.308 --> 01:13:40.839
There will be
no more opium for you.

01:13:41.913 --> 01:13:45.367
There is plenty of pain waiting
for you in the next life.

01:13:45.519 --> 01:13:49.050
I don't know why
you are so greedy for it
in this one.

01:13:53.422 --> 01:13:54.765
Are you a free man, Ravi?

01:13:54.919 --> 01:13:56.799
[dry chuckle] "Free."

01:13:58.332 --> 01:14:00.558
I am. Mm.

01:14:00.712 --> 01:14:02.053
I laid down my sword

01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:04.086
and I swore never
to pick it up again.

01:14:04.241 --> 01:14:05.813
And yet
you choose this hell?

01:14:05.966 --> 01:14:07.348
Mm-hm.

01:14:07.501 --> 01:14:08.921
What was your home before?

01:14:10.033 --> 01:14:11.261
Varanasi.

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:13.600
And why don't you go back?

01:14:13.754 --> 01:14:15.020
I wish I could.

01:14:15.173 --> 01:14:16.938
[breath hissing]
But...

01:14:19.239 --> 01:14:21.311
I met a woman.
[laughs]
Ah.

01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:24.226
It's always a woman.
Always.

01:14:24.381 --> 01:14:28.255
She is from Londinium.
Britannia. You know.

01:14:28.408 --> 01:14:29.980
So now...

01:14:30.135 --> 01:14:32.819
our sons,
they speak only Latin.

01:14:32.974 --> 01:14:35.389
My daughter's eyes,
they are as blue as yours.

01:14:35.543 --> 01:14:37.001
[chuckles lightly]

01:14:38.037 --> 01:14:39.302
We are Romans now.

01:14:39.456 --> 01:14:43.215
I grew up hearing stories
at my grandfather's knee.

01:14:44.174 --> 01:14:47.589
He used to talk
of the dream that was Rome.

01:14:49.546 --> 01:14:53.573
It was so fragile,
you could only whisper it...

01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:57.524
or it would vanish.

01:14:58.254 --> 01:14:59.595
[whispering] So,

01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:01.131
what was this dream?

01:15:01.283 --> 01:15:05.926
A Rome where all could live
under fair law and be protected.

01:15:06.693 --> 01:15:08.650
A Rome of the Senate.

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:11.680
A Rome of hope.

01:15:14.404 --> 01:15:18.699
Your grandfather,
he sounds like
a dangerous man.

01:15:18.853 --> 01:15:20.081
Hm.

01:15:22.536 --> 01:15:24.685
The odds are against you.

01:15:24.838 --> 01:15:26.142
[light chuckle]

01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:28.943
The odds
are always against me.

01:15:29.748 --> 01:15:30.823
Don't worry, old man.

01:15:30.975 --> 01:15:32.702
Eh?
[both laughing]

01:15:32.855 --> 01:15:34.697
[muttering]

01:15:36.039 --> 01:15:38.226
You should
get some rest. Hm?
Mm.

01:15:39.109 --> 01:15:41.678
Your men will need you
to lead them tomorrow.

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:51.883
[gates rumbling open]

01:15:52.035 --> 01:15:54.798
[crowd cheering]
[drums thudding]

01:15:57.176 --> 01:15:58.979
This is about survival.

01:15:59.938 --> 01:16:01.089
Survive!

01:16:01.243 --> 01:16:04.810
[announcer]
In the name of Poseidon,

01:16:04.964 --> 01:16:08.915
we celebrate the glory
of naval war.

01:16:09.069 --> 01:16:10.641
[Lucius]
They have archers.

01:16:10.795 --> 01:16:13.059
Be ready.
Listen for my commands.

01:16:13.211 --> 01:16:15.897
Stay together
and pull as one, yes?

01:16:16.050 --> 01:16:16.818
[all] Yes!

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:19.310
Yes?
Yes!

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.646
[hull creaking]

01:16:25.717 --> 01:16:28.326
[announcer]
Today we relive

01:16:28.479 --> 01:16:31.817
the Battle of Salamis!

01:16:31.971 --> 01:16:32.891
[crowd cheering]

01:16:33.045 --> 01:16:37.610
The Trojans
versus the Persians!

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:43.479
Oars out!
[all] Oars!

01:16:44.092 --> 01:16:46.010
And... pull!

01:16:46.163 --> 01:16:47.851
[all grunting explosively]

01:17:04.885 --> 01:17:06.840
Archers!
[men yelling]

01:17:06.994 --> 01:17:07.953
Archers!

01:17:09.948 --> 01:17:10.983
Pull!

01:17:19.423 --> 01:17:20.997
Pull!

01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:23.644
[all grunting]
[screams]

01:17:23.797 --> 01:17:24.794
Pull!

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.748
[grunts, screams]

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.538
[muffled screaming]

01:17:36.073 --> 01:17:37.224
[all yelling]

01:17:37.377 --> 01:17:39.793
Pull! To my time!

01:17:40.445 --> 01:17:41.749
And... now!

01:17:44.167 --> 01:17:46.391
Left side! Ready, and

01:17:46.544 --> 01:17:48.347
ship oars now!

01:17:48.501 --> 01:17:50.573
Oars in! Oars in!

01:17:51.953 --> 01:17:52.874
Get down!

01:17:54.984 --> 01:17:56.096
[screams]

01:17:57.287 --> 01:17:58.820
[straining]

01:18:01.123 --> 01:18:03.233
[crowd cheering]

01:18:08.257 --> 01:18:11.941
And pull! And pull!

01:18:12.093 --> 01:18:14.549
[men grunting rhythmically]

01:18:14.703 --> 01:18:16.813
[man] Don't stop!

01:18:16.965 --> 01:18:18.921
[grunting]

01:18:19.075 --> 01:18:20.111
Pull!

01:18:20.265 --> 01:18:21.914
[men shout in unison]

01:18:22.758 --> 01:18:24.140
And right!

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.738
Ready to ram!

01:18:30.891 --> 01:18:32.848
[Romans shouting, indistinct]

01:18:33.001 --> 01:18:35.340
And brace! Brace!

01:18:35.494 --> 01:18:37.335
[all yelling]

01:18:43.089 --> 01:18:44.548
[all shouting]

01:18:49.036 --> 01:18:51.990
[cheering]

01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:01.388
[all grunting]

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.181
[gasping]

01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:15.237
[soldier] Everyone regroup!

01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:20.761
[screaming]

01:19:20.915 --> 01:19:22.833
[fighting grunts]

01:19:46.424 --> 01:19:47.997
[grunts]

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.801
[crowd exclaiming]

01:19:49.953 --> 01:19:51.948
Praetorians!

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:55.478
[crowd chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:19:55.631 --> 01:19:56.437
Move, move.

01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:59.084
[chanting continues]

01:20:03.035 --> 01:20:06.143
[announcer]
In the name of the emperors...

01:20:06.295 --> 01:20:10.784
the victor is Hanno!

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:15.503
[all chanting in support]

01:20:21.908 --> 01:20:23.826
Who did this?

01:20:26.396 --> 01:20:28.545
Who did this?!

01:20:29.121 --> 01:20:31.077
It was me!
I did it!

01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:33.225
I did it! I did it! I did it!
It was me!

01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:39.594
Geta will want retribution
for all of you.

01:20:40.438 --> 01:20:41.588
Did you learn to shoot
in the same place

01:20:41.741 --> 01:20:43.123
you learned to recite poetry?

01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:44.274
Be glad it wasn't me,

01:20:44.427 --> 01:20:45.807
or that arrow
would have found you.

01:20:45.962 --> 01:20:48.033
[men laughing]

01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:51.446
[indistinct chatter]

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.979
[faint music playing]

01:21:01.037 --> 01:21:02.495
Be seated.

01:21:04.796 --> 01:21:06.255
I have news for you.

01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:11.971
He's here, sir.

01:21:12.775 --> 01:21:14.655
[door opens]

01:21:14.809 --> 01:21:16.881
[Macrinus]
Oh, still here.

01:21:17.455 --> 01:21:18.799
[Thraex laughs nervously]

01:21:18.952 --> 01:21:20.102
Macrinus.

01:21:20.256 --> 01:21:22.482
[Macrinus chuckles]
Welcome.

01:21:23.824 --> 01:21:25.971
Yes, I'm listening.

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:28.466
You know
this is my house now.

01:21:28.619 --> 01:21:30.920
Your debt to me is
over 10,000 denarii.

01:21:31.074 --> 01:21:32.187
You know that.

01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.949
[chuckles, stammers]
I have other things. Uh...

01:21:35.102 --> 01:21:36.713
Cattle. Art!

01:21:36.867 --> 01:21:38.324
Truth, then.

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:39.859
What do you... want?

01:21:40.013 --> 01:21:42.467
Truth.
That's what I want.

01:21:42.621 --> 01:21:47.109
Nothing happens in Rome
without your knowledge.

01:21:48.029 --> 01:21:50.101
You have
the senators' trust.

01:21:50.791 --> 01:21:52.786
You have
Lucilla's trust.

01:21:52.939 --> 01:21:55.740
More importantly,
you have my trust.

01:21:57.581 --> 01:22:01.341
You wish my... loyalty?

01:22:01.494 --> 01:22:03.182
I own...

01:22:04.448 --> 01:22:06.136
your house.

01:22:06.289 --> 01:22:08.936
I want your loyalty.

01:22:12.505 --> 01:22:13.923
I...

01:22:14.959 --> 01:22:16.647
Tell me.
I have heard...

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:19.371
of a plot...

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.631
to dethrone the emperors.
Yes.

01:22:22.785 --> 01:22:25.049
But the plan
has been delayed, uh...

01:22:25.202 --> 01:22:28.232
A gladiator is to be rescued
from the arena.

01:22:28.385 --> 01:22:29.537
Tonight.
Mm.

01:22:29.691 --> 01:22:32.950
I don't know why.
I know why. I know who.

01:22:35.175 --> 01:22:36.250
Pack.

01:22:39.702 --> 01:22:41.237
Quickly.

01:23:07.744 --> 01:23:08.934
[pounding on gate]
[man] Open up!

01:23:09.088 --> 01:23:11.198
[rats squeaking]

01:23:23.588 --> 01:23:25.238
[mastiffs growling]

01:23:28.153 --> 01:23:30.148
[man] Open for
the emperors' guard!

01:23:30.301 --> 01:23:31.913
[pounding on door]

01:23:53.509 --> 01:23:55.121
[heavy knocking]

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:59.993
My Lady, come with us.

01:24:10.236 --> 01:24:11.961
[all grunting with impact]

01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:45.335
Thanks to the civic virtue

01:24:45.489 --> 01:24:48.212
of men like Thraex
and Macrinus,

01:24:49.363 --> 01:24:51.089
your insurrection

01:24:51.704 --> 01:24:53.661
has been revealed.

01:24:55.425 --> 01:24:56.653
The honor,

01:24:57.535 --> 01:25:01.525
the dignitas that Rome
has bestowed upon you...

01:25:03.634 --> 01:25:06.626
all this you have forfeited
by your treachery.

01:25:06.779 --> 01:25:08.737
Please, Emperor Geta.

01:25:09.311 --> 01:25:11.229
Torture me if you want,

01:25:11.997 --> 01:25:13.186
but do not lecture me.

01:25:13.339 --> 01:25:16.831
Your name
will be forgotten!

01:25:17.752 --> 01:25:20.781
Lost... to history.

01:25:22.547 --> 01:25:23.927
You are damned,
General.

01:25:24.081 --> 01:25:25.730
[laughing]

01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.492
[Geta]
You laugh.
You damn me?

01:25:29.489 --> 01:25:30.871
I don't care.

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:34.514
Everything is forgotten in time.
Empires fall. So do emperors.

01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:36.164
[Caracalla] Why wait?

01:25:36.317 --> 01:25:39.386
I will gut him right now!
No, no, no!

01:25:39.541 --> 01:25:42.648
Let them be. Come! Come!

01:25:42.801 --> 01:25:44.528
His death must be public.

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:45.908
Public? [grunts]

01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:48.862
Hang his entrails
from the city gates!

01:25:49.016 --> 01:25:50.626
And crucify her!

01:25:51.241 --> 01:25:52.583
Crucify her!

01:25:52.736 --> 01:25:54.386
Take them away!

01:25:54.539 --> 01:25:57.993
[Caracalla yells]
[Geta] Shh! Shh! Shh!

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:11.725
Thank you, Macrinus.

01:26:17.710 --> 01:26:19.054
Come on.

01:26:22.237 --> 01:26:23.888
In these last days,

01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.148
I have come to think of you
not as a subject

01:26:27.301 --> 01:26:29.412
but as a true friend.

01:26:29.566 --> 01:26:30.946
Thank you.

01:26:31.099 --> 01:26:33.670
Thank you so much.
But as a friend,

01:26:33.823 --> 01:26:36.395
I must counsel caution.

01:26:36.547 --> 01:26:39.501
Acacius is a hero of Rome.

01:26:40.193 --> 01:26:43.606
Crucifixion
is for thieves.

01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:44.796
Christians.

01:26:45.679 --> 01:26:48.710
It's too common.
He is a traitor.
He must die.

01:26:48.863 --> 01:26:49.899
I agree.

01:26:50.051 --> 01:26:55.845
Let the gods decide
his fate in the Colosseum.

01:27:01.829 --> 01:27:03.518
Let the gods decide.

01:27:05.935 --> 01:27:10.078
You know, last night I woke,
dreaming of a dark river.

01:27:11.382 --> 01:27:13.262
This time,
for the first time,

01:27:13.417 --> 01:27:14.950
I was crossing it.

01:27:15.642 --> 01:27:17.022
[Ravi] Hm.

01:27:17.175 --> 01:27:19.478
Well, you know,
where I come from,

01:27:19.632 --> 01:27:22.546
crossing a river,
it represents forgiveness.

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:25.348
Represents... salvation.

01:27:25.501 --> 01:27:28.608
Where I come from,
it means
you're already dead.

01:27:28.762 --> 01:27:31.447
[chuckles]

01:27:36.512 --> 01:27:39.120
But as I saw it,
I was not afraid.

01:27:40.694 --> 01:27:42.036
For...

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:45.183
For someone was waiting
for me on the other side.

01:27:46.639 --> 01:27:48.443
There. [sniffs]

01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:59.761
Who is this man?

01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:02.447
Scratched out?

01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:05.286
Maximus.

01:28:07.778 --> 01:28:09.850
I saw him fight once.

01:28:10.656 --> 01:28:12.076
He was magnificent.
Mm.

01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:14.954
Yeah. My time in the arena,
it was after his,

01:28:15.107 --> 01:28:19.326
but many still talked of him
in whispers, you know?

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.667
Spoke of him.

01:28:22.357 --> 01:28:23.930
What he did.

01:28:24.084 --> 01:28:26.002
I met him once.

01:28:27.652 --> 01:28:29.187
He was kind.

01:28:31.259 --> 01:28:33.215
He bowed to no one.

01:28:36.437 --> 01:28:37.934
Come with me.

01:28:38.088 --> 01:28:41.118
Hmm?
Come. With me.

01:28:59.150 --> 01:29:03.178
When a rebel gladiator dies,
we bury them here.

01:29:03.331 --> 01:29:07.744
"What we do in life
echoes in eternity."

01:29:24.623 --> 01:29:26.311
This is Argento.

01:29:26.465 --> 01:29:28.077
This is Scatto.

01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:37.745
[cheering, applause]

01:29:40.584 --> 01:29:43.154
[drums thudding]

01:29:50.327 --> 01:29:53.358
[metal clanking]

01:30:01.914 --> 01:30:04.024
[horns playing fanfare]

01:30:06.748 --> 01:30:08.398
Cheers.

01:30:08.974 --> 01:30:10.392
And stop.

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:15.610
For his treason
against the lives

01:30:15.764 --> 01:30:19.677
of the emperors
and the Roman state,

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:23.206
General Justus Acacius,

01:30:24.396 --> 01:30:27.119
an enemy of the people!

01:30:27.274 --> 01:30:29.575
[all chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

01:30:29.728 --> 01:30:32.261
[man] We love you, Acacius!
You are a hero!

01:30:33.374 --> 01:30:36.251
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

01:30:36.404 --> 01:30:39.666
[chanting continues]

01:30:43.079 --> 01:30:45.382
[crowd roaring]

01:30:58.655 --> 01:31:01.648
[crowd jeering loudly]

01:31:06.328 --> 01:31:08.975
[Acacius]<i> Vae victis.</i>
[soldiers] General.

01:31:09.129 --> 01:31:11.662
[all shouting, grunting]

01:31:15.306 --> 01:31:16.571
[pained yell]

01:31:16.725 --> 01:31:18.758
[grunts]

01:31:26.393 --> 01:31:28.081
[crowd cheering]

01:31:28.234 --> 01:31:29.999
[panting heavily]

01:31:30.153 --> 01:31:32.186
[scattered shouts]
Acacius!

01:31:33.145 --> 01:31:37.174
[crowd chanting]
Acacius! Acacius! Acacius!

01:31:37.328 --> 01:31:40.818
[all continue chanting]

01:31:42.851 --> 01:31:46.919
[announcer]
From the vanquished city
of Numidia,

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:52.942
the victor of two conquests
in the Colosseum...

01:31:53.095 --> 01:31:55.666
Go now.<i> Vae victis.</i>

01:31:59.618 --> 01:32:02.342
[crowd chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:32:02.495 --> 01:32:04.604
Hanno!
[crowd cheering]

01:32:04.758 --> 01:32:07.291
Oh, Lord, any honor I have,

01:32:07.443 --> 01:32:09.055
I will give it to you!
It's too late.

01:32:09.209 --> 01:32:12.431
[announcer]
The Roman traitor or

01:32:12.584 --> 01:32:14.849
the barbarian hero.

01:32:15.461 --> 01:32:17.149
Let the gods decide.

01:32:17.303 --> 01:32:19.029
Lucius... wait.

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:21.409
Wait! Wait!

01:32:21.562 --> 01:32:23.863
[both grunting heavily]

01:32:28.123 --> 01:32:30.962
[overlapping
cheers and jeers]

01:32:31.115 --> 01:32:33.801
I am a vessel.

01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:37.253
Fill me with vengeance

01:32:38.021 --> 01:32:40.322
and vanquish the betrayer.

01:32:43.046 --> 01:32:46.269
[attacking grunts]

01:32:57.242 --> 01:32:59.619
We love you, Acacius!
Move it!

01:33:03.456 --> 01:33:04.915
Pick it up!

01:33:05.067 --> 01:33:07.254
[woman]
Bravo, Hanno!

01:33:07.408 --> 01:33:08.751
[man]
We love you, Acacius!

01:33:08.903 --> 01:33:09.824
[man 2]
What are you waiting for?

01:33:09.978 --> 01:33:10.898
[man 3]
You will die!

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:14.045
[cheering and booing]

01:33:18.112 --> 01:33:19.877
[crowd whooping]

01:33:22.677 --> 01:33:24.364
[both grunting heavily]

01:33:27.088 --> 01:33:29.545
[crowd groaning]

01:33:37.371 --> 01:33:38.982
[pained grunting]

01:33:39.136 --> 01:33:40.516
[panting]

01:33:40.670 --> 01:33:42.052
[Acacius]
I know who you are.

01:33:43.662 --> 01:33:45.735
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

01:33:51.949 --> 01:33:54.289
[crowd groaning]

01:33:56.054 --> 01:33:58.203
[crowd exclaiming]

01:33:58.357 --> 01:34:00.428
Acacius
has raised his hand!

01:34:01.272 --> 01:34:03.458
He has surrendered.

01:34:03.612 --> 01:34:05.991
[all muttering]

01:34:10.748 --> 01:34:12.782
Let the gods decide.

01:34:20.608 --> 01:34:22.909
[monkey screeching]

01:34:29.431 --> 01:34:32.385
The gods have rendered
their judgment.

01:34:35.301 --> 01:34:36.836
Do what you must.

01:34:37.757 --> 01:34:40.173
But on my death,
you have to know...

01:34:41.786 --> 01:34:43.818
I love your mother,
Lucilla.

01:34:45.122 --> 01:34:46.543
And your father...

01:34:49.113 --> 01:34:50.187
Maximus.

01:34:51.300 --> 01:34:53.409
I would have died
for him.

01:34:53.562 --> 01:34:55.136
Kill him!

01:34:55.288 --> 01:34:58.012
[man] Let him live!
Please!

01:34:58.894 --> 01:35:02.077
[crowd chanting]
Live! Live! Live! Live!

01:35:08.674 --> 01:35:10.401
Kill him!

01:35:12.089 --> 01:35:13.086
[grunts]
[Geta] Kill him!

01:35:13.239 --> 01:35:14.275
Archers!

01:35:14.427 --> 01:35:16.078
No!
[Geta] Kill him!

01:35:16.231 --> 01:35:18.685
[crowd chanting]
Acacius! Acacius!

01:35:18.839 --> 01:35:20.411
[Caracalla] Kill him!

01:35:20.564 --> 01:35:21.792
Kill him!

01:35:21.946 --> 01:35:23.249
Kill him! Kill him!

01:35:23.402 --> 01:35:25.320
[crowd continues chanting]

01:35:25.475 --> 01:35:26.817
[sobbing] Acacius!

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.653
[arrow whistling]

01:35:30.805 --> 01:35:31.802
[crowd exclaiming]

01:35:31.956 --> 01:35:33.988
[grunting]

01:35:36.444 --> 01:35:37.517
[Lucilla] No!

01:35:38.055 --> 01:35:39.435
No!

01:35:39.588 --> 01:35:41.200
Acacius!

01:35:43.539 --> 01:35:45.380
Damn you!

01:35:45.533 --> 01:35:47.068
[breath heaving]

01:35:47.221 --> 01:35:49.177
Death will be
too good for you!

01:35:54.356 --> 01:35:57.540
Is this how Rome
treats its heroes?

01:36:01.337 --> 01:36:02.833
Tell me!

01:36:04.558 --> 01:36:09.008
If his life has no value,
what are yours worth?

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:13.955
The gods have spoken!

01:36:14.108 --> 01:36:16.679
[crowd booing loudly]

01:36:18.635 --> 01:36:21.320
[shouting, jeering]

01:36:27.302 --> 01:36:31.024
[crowd chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:37.850
[crowd booing]

01:36:45.521 --> 01:36:48.743
For our own safety,
we should return to the palace.

01:36:49.856 --> 01:36:53.769
[crowd booing loudly]

01:36:56.568 --> 01:36:59.790
[crowd]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

01:37:06.808 --> 01:37:08.803
[all jeering]

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:11.411
[soldier]
Stay back! Stay back!

01:37:36.918 --> 01:37:39.680
[booing and jeers, echoing]

01:37:44.397 --> 01:37:46.430
[crowd noise fades]

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:57.362
[thunder rolling]

01:37:57.514 --> 01:38:01.888
[Lucius, faintly] Arishat!

01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:06.221
[door opens]

01:38:18.648 --> 01:38:20.183
We had a bargain.

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:26.587
I gave him to you.
You let him live.

01:38:26.742 --> 01:38:28.198
And you got
what you wanted.

01:38:28.352 --> 01:38:30.846
I always get what I want.
Why did you let him live?

01:38:30.998 --> 01:38:33.952
You bought a gladiator,
not a slave.

01:38:35.487 --> 01:38:37.328
My will is my own.

01:38:39.399 --> 01:38:40.587
Ah...

01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:43.235
How blue is your blood?

01:38:43.388 --> 01:38:45.765
Perhaps the heart of a Roman

01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:48.221
beats in that chest.
[chuckles]

01:38:53.514 --> 01:38:56.274
The greatest temple
Rome ever built.

01:38:56.429 --> 01:38:57.695
The Colosseum.

01:38:57.847 --> 01:39:00.187
Because this is
what they believe in.

01:39:00.341 --> 01:39:01.607
Power.

01:39:01.759 --> 01:39:04.292
They gather here to watch
the strong strike down the weak.

01:39:04.445 --> 01:39:06.094
There has to be
something else.
There is nothing else.

01:39:06.248 --> 01:39:09.278
There has to be
another Rome.
There is no other Rome.

01:39:10.619 --> 01:39:12.078
The "dream"?
Mm.

01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:13.919
The dream of Rome?

01:39:14.072 --> 01:39:15.721
It's an old man's fantasy.

01:39:17.331 --> 01:39:18.752
Who are you?

01:39:21.398 --> 01:39:24.582
What was your name
before you traded it
for a Roman one?

01:39:25.464 --> 01:39:26.997
You'll never know.

01:39:29.528 --> 01:39:31.217
I have a destiny.

01:39:34.361 --> 01:39:36.817
The gods delivered you to me.

01:39:39.578 --> 01:39:40.997
You will be my instrument.

01:39:41.150 --> 01:39:44.603
I will never be
your instrument,
in this life or the next.

01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:55.610
[door opening]
That will not be my destiny.

01:39:57.413 --> 01:39:58.871
But I will see your end.

01:39:59.025 --> 01:40:01.671
[people shouting,
yelling in distance]

01:40:17.052 --> 01:40:19.008
[monkey chittering]

01:40:19.161 --> 01:40:20.810
What else could I do?

01:40:20.964 --> 01:40:22.535
He and his bitch
were plotting to kill us.

01:40:22.690 --> 01:40:25.259
Don't you hear them?
They're calling for our heads!

01:40:25.412 --> 01:40:27.253
The Praetorians
will put down this crowd.

01:40:27.407 --> 01:40:29.056
Like they have every other.
You brought this on us.

01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:31.780
Filthy ape!
[monkey squeaking in fear]

01:40:35.078 --> 01:40:37.609
[Macrinus]
Perhaps you should, uh,

01:40:37.763 --> 01:40:42.174
take Dondus elsewhere
to comfort him?

01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:53.528
Forgive
my brother's outburst.

01:40:55.137 --> 01:40:56.596
The disease
that infects his loins

01:40:56.748 --> 01:40:58.437
has spread to his brain.

01:40:58.590 --> 01:41:01.773
Every day he gets worse.
I will reason with him.

01:41:03.193 --> 01:41:05.149
[all yelling, shouting]

01:41:10.441 --> 01:41:12.897
[Dondus hooting]

01:41:17.307 --> 01:41:20.300
[singsong] I see you.

01:41:20.453 --> 01:41:22.486
I see you.

01:41:23.674 --> 01:41:25.783
Caracalla, Caracalla!

01:41:25.937 --> 01:41:27.357
Come on, stand up.

01:41:27.509 --> 01:41:29.465
Get up, get up.
Not you.

01:41:29.619 --> 01:41:31.460
All right,
there you go.

01:41:32.995 --> 01:41:35.142
Now, listen to me.

01:41:35.296 --> 01:41:36.677
What's the matter?

01:41:36.831 --> 01:41:39.323
[panting]
Nothing's ever mine.

01:41:39.477 --> 01:41:41.625
Everything is ours,
always.

01:41:41.779 --> 01:41:45.038
Even in the womb...
[stammering] he tried...

01:41:45.728 --> 01:41:48.758
to cut my umbilicus

01:41:48.912 --> 01:41:50.599
so that I couldn't have
any more air.

01:41:50.753 --> 01:41:52.940
You remember that,
do you?
Certainly.

01:41:53.093 --> 01:41:55.240
Come, sit.
One cannot forget.

01:41:55.394 --> 01:41:57.619
My conscience compels me.

01:41:57.773 --> 01:41:59.076
What?

01:41:59.229 --> 01:42:00.265
Sit.

01:42:00.418 --> 01:42:01.838
Your brother

01:42:02.605 --> 01:42:04.100
means to blame you

01:42:04.944 --> 01:42:07.246
in front of
the entire Senate...

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.512
But I did not do it!

01:42:08.665 --> 01:42:10.161
...for what's happening
in the streets.

01:42:10.315 --> 01:42:12.539
The chaos!
He's lying!

01:42:12.692 --> 01:42:14.342
No testimony
can be more damning

01:42:14.495 --> 01:42:17.756
than one brother
against another.

01:42:17.909 --> 01:42:20.440
That's a lie!
He always lies!

01:42:20.593 --> 01:42:22.857
He can be very persuasive.

01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:25.427
So?
What will they do to me?

01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:28.304
Oh, I don't dare imagine.
But imagine this:

01:42:28.457 --> 01:42:30.566
What will they do to Dondus?

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:36.128
What will they do

01:42:36.281 --> 01:42:37.469
to Dondus?

01:42:37.623 --> 01:42:39.694
[Dondus
chittering softly]

01:42:39.848 --> 01:42:41.191
It's your decision.

01:42:50.203 --> 01:42:52.736
[people shouting angrily]

01:43:04.663 --> 01:43:08.345
[angry shouts continue]

01:43:17.437 --> 01:43:18.319
Brother.

01:43:21.655 --> 01:43:23.382
Put down the blade.

01:43:23.534 --> 01:43:24.416
You lie.

01:43:24.570 --> 01:43:26.258
Give it to me.
You always lie!

01:43:26.411 --> 01:43:27.293
Give it-- [grunts]

01:43:27.446 --> 01:43:29.097
[chuckles]

01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:30.899
[Geta exclaiming]

01:43:31.053 --> 01:43:33.123
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:43:33.276 --> 01:43:35.579
Lie!
Listen to me.
Break the spell.

01:43:35.732 --> 01:43:37.458
Lie!
Break the spell!

01:43:37.612 --> 01:43:40.909
I've always protected you.
Because I love you.

01:43:41.485 --> 01:43:43.518
Come back. Help me.

01:43:50.345 --> 01:43:51.956
[blade plunges]

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.218
[faint, indistinct chatter]

01:43:54.372 --> 01:43:56.136
[keys jingling]

01:44:02.925 --> 01:44:04.345
Lucius.

01:44:10.519 --> 01:44:12.744
[hinges creaking]

01:44:24.941 --> 01:44:27.512
Never could have imagined
the fates would lead us here.

01:44:27.665 --> 01:44:29.468
[Lucius chuckles dryly]

01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.462
And yet here we are.

01:44:32.842 --> 01:44:34.492
Everything has
brought us full circle.

01:44:34.645 --> 01:44:37.445
You sent me away
and yet fate

01:44:37.598 --> 01:44:40.245
brought me back
to the very ground
where he died.

01:44:43.045 --> 01:44:44.080
[Lucilla] This ring...

01:44:45.769 --> 01:44:47.533
belonged to my father.

01:44:51.215 --> 01:44:54.169
He gave it
to your father,
Maximus,

01:44:54.322 --> 01:44:56.240
as a token of trust.

01:44:57.391 --> 01:45:00.458
I gave it to Acacius
for his valor.

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.903
This ring belonged to my wife.

01:45:09.588 --> 01:45:11.159
I shall wear it next to yours.

01:45:24.699 --> 01:45:27.192
I am truly sorry for Acacius.

01:45:28.304 --> 01:45:30.951
I could not see the man.

01:45:31.104 --> 01:45:32.447
[sniffles]

01:45:33.137 --> 01:45:35.055
He was a soldier of Rome.

01:45:36.819 --> 01:45:38.239
There was a plan.

01:45:39.313 --> 01:45:40.540
He was readying troops
at Ostia

01:45:40.693 --> 01:45:43.531
under the command
of Darius Sextus.

01:45:43.684 --> 01:45:46.792
Troops he was to lead
against the emperors.

01:45:48.594 --> 01:45:52.967
Acacius. Maximus.
Marcus Aurelius.

01:45:53.888 --> 01:45:56.303
They lived and died
for Rome.

01:45:56.955 --> 01:45:58.414
We all do.

01:46:00.139 --> 01:46:02.632
Is it true
they intend to kill you?

01:46:03.668 --> 01:46:05.088
[chuckles lightly]

01:46:05.241 --> 01:46:07.197
One man or another
has had a sword
against my neck

01:46:07.351 --> 01:46:09.766
since the day
my father died.

01:46:12.643 --> 01:46:14.753
But now
that I've found you,

01:46:15.443 --> 01:46:17.284
it doesn't matter.

01:46:18.512 --> 01:46:19.930
I am not afraid.

01:46:20.084 --> 01:46:23.306
I've become well versed
in losing the things
that I love.

01:46:25.875 --> 01:46:26.988
But now that I've found you,

01:46:27.142 --> 01:46:28.867
I have no desire
to lose you again.

01:46:29.021 --> 01:46:31.246
[exhales shakily]

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.123
You stand like him.
Mm.

01:46:34.775 --> 01:46:36.156
Alert.

01:46:36.961 --> 01:46:38.073
Proud.

01:46:40.028 --> 01:46:42.676
I do not have his strength.

01:46:43.443 --> 01:46:45.591
I wish that were true.

01:46:46.703 --> 01:46:49.771
I wish I were telling you
to flee this place.

01:46:49.924 --> 01:46:51.498
[keys jingling]

01:46:54.795 --> 01:46:57.021
[door unlocks]

01:46:58.324 --> 01:46:59.436
Go now.

01:47:04.039 --> 01:47:05.995
[Lucilla sighs]

01:47:07.299 --> 01:47:08.489
Strength and honor.

01:47:10.789 --> 01:47:12.516
Strength and honor.

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:24.367
[thunder rumbling faintly]

01:47:24.521 --> 01:47:26.516
[Caracalla] As Emperor,

01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:28.279
I have convened

01:47:29.008 --> 01:47:32.000
the Senate to appoint
my First Consul

01:47:32.153 --> 01:47:35.338
and bestow upon him the power
to administer the military

01:47:35.491 --> 01:47:38.827
and civic functions
of the Empire.

01:47:42.433 --> 01:47:43.814
I name...

01:47:44.773 --> 01:47:47.074
Citizen Dondus!

01:47:47.227 --> 01:47:48.877
[Senate murmuring]

01:47:49.031 --> 01:47:51.485
[Dondus chittering]

01:47:53.787 --> 01:47:55.551
[Caracalla]
Hail Dondus!

01:47:58.734 --> 01:48:00.269
Hail Dondus!

01:48:01.955 --> 01:48:04.640
[clearing throat]
Hail Dondus.
Hail Dondus!

01:48:04.794 --> 01:48:07.249
[all] Hail Dondus!

01:48:11.161 --> 01:48:13.078
As Second Consul...

01:48:14.844 --> 01:48:16.378
I name...

01:48:18.564 --> 01:48:19.906
Citizen...

01:48:22.054 --> 01:48:23.474
Macrinus!

01:48:25.659 --> 01:48:27.232
Hail Macrinus!

01:48:27.386 --> 01:48:28.689
Hail Macrinus!

01:48:28.843 --> 01:48:30.800
[all] Hail Macrinus!

01:48:32.333 --> 01:48:34.865
There will be
a triumphal parade
to celebrate.

01:48:35.019 --> 01:48:36.630
There will be games

01:48:37.242 --> 01:48:39.083
and mass executions.

01:48:39.237 --> 01:48:41.616
[chittering]

01:48:42.113 --> 01:48:44.837
Long live the Empire!

01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:47.829
[Macrinus]
Long live the Empire!

01:48:47.982 --> 01:48:49.747
[all] Long live the Empire!

01:48:52.356 --> 01:48:54.160
[applause subsides]

01:48:55.809 --> 01:48:56.999
Sit down.

01:49:00.143 --> 01:49:02.868
I happen to have...

01:49:06.051 --> 01:49:09.811
with good fortune
and not a little skill...

01:49:11.347 --> 01:49:14.491
the remaining emperor's ear.

01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:19.134
[all gasping, murmuring]

01:49:21.243 --> 01:49:23.585
I can speak logic to it...

01:49:27.919 --> 01:49:30.528
and tame the madness
in the street. But...

01:49:33.252 --> 01:49:34.939
to restore order...

01:49:36.781 --> 01:49:38.699
I must have power...

01:49:42.191 --> 01:49:44.185
and command

01:49:44.761 --> 01:49:46.756
over the Praetorian Army.

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:54.083
Ballot...

01:49:56.117 --> 01:49:57.498
or hand?

01:49:59.455 --> 01:50:01.987
Aye!
[all] Aye!

01:50:05.056 --> 01:50:06.705
Your humble servant.

01:50:10.542 --> 01:50:12.152
Put your hands down.

01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:16.142
You can sit down.

01:50:28.956 --> 01:50:30.683
[Macrinus]<i> Rome must fall.</i>

01:50:33.137 --> 01:50:35.247
I need only
give it a push.

01:50:38.009 --> 01:50:40.274
[Lucilla]
And after Rome falls...

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.496
[dry chuckle]
...what then?

01:50:45.376 --> 01:50:47.485
You are
your father's child.

01:50:49.174 --> 01:50:52.588
His dream of Rome
was never a dream.

01:50:52.742 --> 01:50:54.582
It was a fiction.

01:50:54.737 --> 01:50:56.770
"The best revenge is

01:50:56.924 --> 01:51:00.568
to become unlike the one
who did the injury."

01:51:00.722 --> 01:51:05.479
I have made myself
unlike your father.

01:51:05.632 --> 01:51:08.969
He spoke of dreams,
I speak of truth.

01:51:09.123 --> 01:51:11.654
And the only truth
in my Rome

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:15.108
is the law
of the strongest.

01:51:17.255 --> 01:51:18.637
I was owned

01:51:19.942 --> 01:51:21.515
by an emperor.

01:51:24.199 --> 01:51:26.349
Now I control an empire.

01:51:27.192 --> 01:51:30.530
Where else but in Rome
can a man do that?

01:51:35.326 --> 01:51:39.929
Do you recognize
your father's mark on me?

01:51:44.455 --> 01:51:45.837
If there is anything

01:51:46.413 --> 01:51:47.832
you need...

01:51:49.328 --> 01:51:51.092
in these last hours,

01:51:51.936 --> 01:51:53.663
we will provide.

01:51:58.842 --> 01:52:01.758
Your death will clear my path
to the throne.

01:52:03.369 --> 01:52:06.284
Tomorrow
there will be games.

01:52:06.438 --> 01:52:08.049
And at them...

01:52:08.817 --> 01:52:10.544
I will prevail.

01:52:15.837 --> 01:52:17.372
[door clangs shut]

01:52:17.526 --> 01:52:19.252
[keys jingling]

01:52:23.586 --> 01:52:25.045
Ravi!

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:33.369
Can you get me a message
to Ostia by morning?

01:52:33.523 --> 01:52:35.134
What is in Ostia?

01:52:35.287 --> 01:52:36.783
There is an army.

01:52:38.702 --> 01:52:40.314
I'm asking you
to risk yourself, my friend,

01:52:40.467 --> 01:52:42.691
in the service
of something greater.

01:52:45.378 --> 01:52:46.836
Ride to Ostia.

01:52:47.833 --> 01:52:49.905
Take this ring
to General Darius Sextus.

01:52:50.058 --> 01:52:51.515
Are you listening?

01:52:52.015 --> 01:52:54.392
Darius Sextus.

01:52:54.547 --> 01:52:56.695
He will know it
as Acacius's ring.

01:52:59.381 --> 01:53:01.567
[clears throat] And, uh,

01:53:02.296 --> 01:53:03.715
who shall I say has

01:53:04.253 --> 01:53:06.018
sent me with this ring?

01:53:09.087 --> 01:53:11.503
I am Lucius Verus Aurelius.

01:53:12.538 --> 01:53:14.151
The Prince of Rome.

01:53:15.147 --> 01:53:16.528
Tell him
I am summoning the army

01:53:16.683 --> 01:53:19.022
to the defense
of a new Republic.

01:53:21.976 --> 01:53:23.473
[inhales]

01:53:27.194 --> 01:53:28.307
Should I trust you?
Yes.

01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:30.569
Should I?
Yes.

01:53:37.054 --> 01:53:39.778
Ravi! I need your keys.

01:53:45.571 --> 01:53:47.259
Thank you.

01:54:23.473 --> 01:54:25.929
Stop! Come back!

01:54:37.783 --> 01:54:39.854
[panting]

01:54:46.606 --> 01:54:47.873
[inhales sharply]

01:54:55.315 --> 01:54:56.505
Who gave you this?

01:54:57.311 --> 01:54:59.497
Lucius Verus Aurelius.

01:55:00.533 --> 01:55:01.875
The Prince of Rome.

01:55:22.324 --> 01:55:24.396
[horses snort, whinnying]

01:55:29.114 --> 01:55:31.569
[crowd cheering
in distance]

01:55:52.630 --> 01:55:55.777
[whispering]
Must we kill Lucilla?

01:55:57.081 --> 01:56:00.956
[quietly] Until she dies,
you will never know peace.

01:56:02.721 --> 01:56:03.757
Ever.

01:56:06.557 --> 01:56:08.706
[horns playing fanfare]

01:56:13.922 --> 01:56:16.378
The people love her.
Her death will incite the mob.

01:56:16.531 --> 01:56:18.949
If she dies and the streets
rise up in anger,

01:56:19.102 --> 01:56:20.482
I shall deliver them
Caracalla's head

01:56:20.636 --> 01:56:21.979
and the people
shall acclaim me.

01:56:22.133 --> 01:56:25.739
That, my friend,
is politics.

01:56:28.309 --> 01:56:30.227
Shall we?
Yes.

01:56:44.651 --> 01:56:46.839
Today will be
your last fight, champion.

01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:49.525
And our master
has bestowed on you...

01:56:51.635 --> 01:56:54.089
the wooden sword of freedom.

01:56:57.734 --> 01:56:59.538
But you have to
earn it first.

01:56:59.690 --> 01:57:02.185
Today, you're gonna
defend your mother.

01:57:08.437 --> 01:57:10.547
[soldier shouting]
[grunting]

01:57:10.701 --> 01:57:12.965
[all yelling]

01:57:20.944 --> 01:57:23.821
[grunting explosively]

01:57:23.974 --> 01:57:26.929
Wood or steel,
a point is still a point!

01:57:29.154 --> 01:57:30.957
[arrows whistling]

01:57:52.978 --> 01:57:54.512
[Lucius] Wait for me.

01:58:12.466 --> 01:58:13.963
In honor

01:58:14.117 --> 01:58:18.183
of the acclamation
of Emperor Caracalla,

01:58:18.336 --> 01:58:23.938
First Consul Dondus
and Second Consul Macrinus,

01:58:24.090 --> 01:58:28.311
and as punishment
for her conspiracy
against the empire,

01:58:28.465 --> 01:58:32.837
for her calumnies against
the emperor's imperial bloodline

01:58:32.991 --> 01:58:35.178
and for fomenting
military mutiny

01:58:35.332 --> 01:58:36.635
along with her husband,

01:58:36.789 --> 01:58:40.204
the queen will face
divine justice

01:58:40.356 --> 01:58:44.538
at the hands
of the Praetorian Guard.

01:58:48.452 --> 01:58:50.907
[crowd cheering faintly]

01:59:07.826 --> 01:59:09.436
I am not a general.

01:59:10.933 --> 01:59:14.463
But we are all soldiers.

01:59:16.188 --> 01:59:17.647
And up until now,

01:59:17.799 --> 01:59:22.020
we have fought for nothing more
than another day's survival.

01:59:22.174 --> 01:59:24.130
What will you
have us do?

01:59:25.166 --> 01:59:26.279
Well, you can return
to your cells

01:59:26.431 --> 01:59:28.426
if you do not wish
to fight this battle.

01:59:28.580 --> 01:59:30.921
[all laughing]
Or...

01:59:32.493 --> 01:59:33.836
you can join me.

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:37.288
And fight for a freedom
far beyond these walls.

01:59:37.443 --> 01:59:38.670
[all] Aye!

01:59:38.823 --> 01:59:43.121
There once was a time when
honor meant something in Rome.

01:59:44.654 --> 01:59:46.151
In this Rome

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.990
I no longer believe
that exists.

01:59:49.144 --> 01:59:50.908
We must find it!

01:59:51.062 --> 01:59:53.018
[all murmuring in agreement]

01:59:53.171 --> 01:59:54.937
[Lucius] And know this:

01:59:56.011 --> 01:59:59.809
Where death is, we are not.

02:00:01.612 --> 02:00:03.568
Where we are,

02:00:04.182 --> 02:00:05.946
death is not!

02:00:08.708 --> 02:00:10.052
By my sword.

02:00:11.739 --> 02:00:13.312
Strength and honor.

02:00:13.465 --> 02:00:15.307
[all] Strength and honor!

02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:16.957
Strength and honor!

02:00:17.111 --> 02:00:19.066
Strength and honor!

02:00:28.082 --> 02:00:30.575
[indistinct shouting]

02:00:30.729 --> 02:00:32.609
[growling]

02:00:37.596 --> 02:00:39.745
[snarling]

02:00:42.623 --> 02:00:44.502
Let it not be said

02:00:44.656 --> 02:00:47.533
that the emperor
is not merciful.

02:00:47.687 --> 02:00:52.942
The queen will be granted
a single gladiator

02:00:53.096 --> 02:00:56.778
to defend her against
the Praetorian Guard.

02:00:56.932 --> 02:00:59.119
[crowd jeering]

02:01:06.407 --> 02:01:10.167
The champion, Hanno!

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:12.355
[crowd roars]

02:01:13.811 --> 02:01:17.419
[people chanting]
Hanno! Hanno! Hanno!

02:01:35.909 --> 02:01:38.057
[all booing]

02:02:08.212 --> 02:02:10.130
[all shouting]

02:02:18.416 --> 02:02:20.142
[grunting]

02:02:20.296 --> 02:02:22.022
Yes!

02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:27.815
Summon the cavalry.
Put this down at once.

02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:31.575
This is war! Real war!

02:02:36.026 --> 02:02:39.594
The army of Acacius
is advancing
just outside of Rome, sir.

02:02:41.934 --> 02:02:43.237
We can still
outflank them.

02:02:43.392 --> 02:02:45.846
They have only
5,000 troops, no more.

02:02:47.074 --> 02:02:48.341
How many are we?

02:02:48.494 --> 02:02:49.759
Six thousand.
Perhaps more.

02:02:49.913 --> 02:02:51.448
Ride to the gate
and hold them.

02:02:51.601 --> 02:02:53.634
[aggressive grunting]

02:03:01.230 --> 02:03:02.689
[cheering]

02:03:16.001 --> 02:03:17.190
[screams]

02:03:17.344 --> 02:03:19.491
[yelps, whimpering]

02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:26.014
[screams]

02:03:26.166 --> 02:03:28.738
[all shouting angrily]

02:03:32.382 --> 02:03:33.725
[screams]

02:03:35.834 --> 02:03:37.675
[arrow whistles]
[grunts]

02:03:41.206 --> 02:03:42.357
Filthy scum!

02:03:55.554 --> 02:03:57.087
[Lucilla] Lucius!

02:03:58.699 --> 02:03:59.811
Give me the bow.

02:04:02.996 --> 02:04:04.607
[bow creaking]

02:04:08.943 --> 02:04:11.053
[both gasp]

02:04:22.485 --> 02:04:24.901
Go, my son. Lucius--

02:04:25.056 --> 02:04:26.091
Shh-sh-sh-sh...

02:04:26.245 --> 02:04:27.510
Horse!

02:04:27.663 --> 02:04:29.851
[people shouting, clamoring]

02:04:34.569 --> 02:04:36.680
[yelling furiously]

02:04:48.648 --> 02:04:50.566
[indistinct shouts]

02:04:51.526 --> 02:04:53.253
[feet marching]

02:04:53.405 --> 02:04:55.938
[man shouting cadence]

02:05:56.476 --> 02:05:58.433
Will nothing
kill this barbarian?

02:05:58.585 --> 02:06:00.849
My name is
Lucius Verus Aurelius!

02:06:01.003 --> 02:06:03.228
[Macrinus]
A man does not become
emperor by bloodline alone.

02:06:03.381 --> 02:06:06.029
It must be taken by force
and kept by force.

02:06:06.182 --> 02:06:07.870
Are you such a man
as this?

02:06:08.024 --> 02:06:09.327
[Lucius]
I don't fight for power.

02:06:09.481 --> 02:06:12.128
I fight to free Rome
from men like you

02:06:12.281 --> 02:06:13.548
and to return it to them.

02:06:13.702 --> 02:06:16.349
The gods themselves
want Rome reborn.

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:19.226
They sent me...
to fulfill that task.

02:06:19.379 --> 02:06:22.946
And what if your gods
sent me here to kill you?

02:06:23.101 --> 02:06:24.137
Huh?

02:06:25.019 --> 02:06:27.244
It's time to end this, Macrinus!

02:06:27.397 --> 02:06:29.391
[aggressive yell]

02:06:35.031 --> 02:06:37.103
[horses bellowing]

02:06:46.924 --> 02:06:49.571
[both grunting]

02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:52.371
[swords clashing]

02:06:52.525 --> 02:06:54.137
[both yelling]

02:07:01.848 --> 02:07:04.111
Hah!
[screams]

02:07:05.070 --> 02:07:05.990
[grunts]

02:07:21.221 --> 02:07:23.062
[blade clanging
against breastplate]

02:07:29.585 --> 02:07:32.424
[metallic clangs echoing]

02:07:32.577 --> 02:07:34.189
[Lucilla]
Strength and honor,

02:07:34.725 --> 02:07:36.222
my son.

02:07:38.446 --> 02:07:39.520
[grunts]

02:07:52.412 --> 02:07:53.639
[yelling]

02:07:55.366 --> 02:07:56.516
[groans in pain]

02:08:22.756 --> 02:08:23.946
[panting]

02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:25.941
[pained groan]

02:09:05.647 --> 02:09:07.451
You look to me to speak.

02:09:09.331 --> 02:09:10.942
I know not what
to say other than

02:09:11.096 --> 02:09:13.129
we have all known
too much death.

02:09:14.126 --> 02:09:17.771
Let no more blood be spilt
in the name of tyranny.

02:09:21.299 --> 02:09:23.679
My grandfather,
Marcus Aurelius,

02:09:23.831 --> 02:09:26.785
talked of a dream
that would be Rome.

02:09:27.630 --> 02:09:29.586
A dream that my father,

02:09:30.583 --> 02:09:33.308
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

02:09:33.461 --> 02:09:35.034
died for.

02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:37.758
An ideal.

02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:44.356
A city for the many
and a refuge
for those in need.

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:47.003
A home worth fighting for.

02:09:47.885 --> 02:09:52.221
A home that Maximus
spent his life defending.

02:09:54.101 --> 02:09:56.019
That dream is lost.

02:10:01.581 --> 02:10:03.269
But dare we...

02:10:04.575 --> 02:10:07.297
rebuild that dream
together?

02:10:18.615 --> 02:10:20.418
What say you?

02:10:26.441 --> 02:10:28.282
Aye!

02:10:29.318 --> 02:10:30.624
Aye!

02:10:31.275 --> 02:10:32.311
Aye!

02:10:32.465 --> 02:10:36.799
[all] Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!

02:10:38.909 --> 02:10:42.286
[all chanting]

02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:40.024
Mother.

02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:32.543
Speak to me, Father.
