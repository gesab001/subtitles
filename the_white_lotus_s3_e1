but this place is clutch.

14:33.821 --> 14:36.047
- I did my research.
- God, you're always right.

50:24.923 --> 50:25.882
with your girlfriends?"

50:25.883 --> 50:28.262
And I was like, "Dave",

50:28.263 --> 50:30.722
it is not
a midlife crisis trip.

50:31.913 --> 50:33.255
"It's a victory tour."

50:33.256 --> 50:36.941
- Victory tour. I love that.

50:50.652 --> 50:51.650
Night night. Love you, too.

50:51.651 --> 50:52.803
- Love you both.
- KATE: I'll get...

50:52.804 --> 50:54.377

she needs to deal with.

52:33.380 --> 52:34.687
What are her issues?

52:36.145 --> 52:38.949
Well, for one, which I'm sure
you've noticed...

52:40.524 --> 52:41.637
she's pretty hot.

52:44.134 --> 52:46.437
But I don't think
she's ever been laid before.

52:48.819 --> 52:52.735
Look, Buddhism is for people
that want to suppress in life.

52:52.736 --> 52:54.694
They're afraid.
Don't get attached.

Don't even try.

You know,

I mean,
getting what you want in life,

53:11.285 --> 53:12.666
that's happiness, bro.

53:14.702 --> 53:15.739
But...

53:17.928 --> 53:20.078
what do I want, I guess?

53:21.538 --> 53:23.303
Pussy.

53:23.304 --> 53:26.645
Money, freedom, respect.

53:33.711 --> 53:37.359
You don't need to shrink away

55:28.614 --> 55:31.838
Saw him in front of the hotel.
Asshole again.
