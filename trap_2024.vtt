01:47.240 --> 01:48.776
We're not gonna break
any laws, Riley.

01:48.969 --> 01:50.428
We'll get there when
you wanted to get there.

01:50.581 --> 01:51.772
I promise.

[resumes singing]

02:00.489 --> 02:02.024
Maybe I'll be a singer.

02:02.216 --> 02:04.214
Yeah, maybe.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.088
[song ends]

02:16.118 --> 02:17.347
Hurry. Come on, come on.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.382
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I gotta tie my shoe.

02:19.613 --> 02:21.994
No dad jokes.
This is serious. Come on.

02:22.185 --> 02:22.992
I'm sorry.

02:23.183 --> 02:24.528
[shouts playfully] I'm sorry!

02:27.139 --> 02:28.868
-[dad] Nope. Nope. Nope.
-[Riley] Yes. Yes.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.711
[dad] Nope, nope, nope...

02:31.900 --> 02:33.321
[Riley laughs]
That's unfair. I'm twelve.

02:33.476 --> 02:35.203
-[dad] Champion!
-[Riley] Oh, whatever.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.045
We're late.
This is frustrating, Dad.

02:38.238 --> 02:39.465
We should have come earlier.

02:39.697 --> 02:41.233
Yeah, this was the earliest
I could get off work, Riley.

02:41.424 --> 02:42.537
Sorry.

03:18.213 --> 03:19.135
[Riley] Put me down.

03:34.149 --> 03:35.417
Oh, my God!

03:36.415 --> 03:38.297
[girls together]
She waved at me.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.638
I think I got a good photo.

03:41.791 --> 03:43.441
That was kind of exciting.

03:44.786 --> 03:45.746
[Riley] I'm so happy she added

03:45.977 --> 03:47.819
this afternoon concert
after she sold out.

03:48.779 --> 03:49.817
Tickets,
I got tenth row tickets.

03:49.971 --> 03:51.737
-No thank you.
-Tenth row?

03:51.928 --> 03:54.847
They wouldn't be real, honey.
Don't let people fool you.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.574
-Our seats are good enough.
-We're row 44.

03:57.803 --> 04:00.607

-[chuckles]

04:00.838 --> 04:02.374
[indistinct chatter]

04:02.604 --> 04:04.485
[dad] So, give me the update.

04:05.715 --> 04:07.480
What's going on
with those girls at school?

04:07.673 --> 04:08.901
It's fine.

04:09.133 --> 04:10.054
It's fine?

04:10.245 --> 04:11.360
I don't really
wanna talk about it.

04:13.740 --> 04:16.006
Okay. Come here.

04:16.198 --> 04:17.503

05:04.699 --> 05:06.887
Yeah, baby. Go!

05:18.906 --> 05:21.519
They aren't mean anymore.
They just don't include me.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.554
They keep posting
stuff together.

05:24.782 --> 05:26.049
[dad] I see.

05:26.242 --> 05:28.738
It must be hard seeing what
everyone's doing all the time.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.308
You guys are so connected
even when you're not that close.

05:34.076 --> 05:36.533
Why don't you and I
take a picture together
when we go inside?

05:36.686 --> 05:37.646
You and your dad.

05:37.801 --> 05:39.643
Jody will be so jelly.

05:40.142 --> 05:40.949
[scoffs]

05:41.180 --> 05:42.830
That would be
like the worst idea.

05:43.022 --> 05:44.559
And don't say jelly, Dad.

06:11.132 --> 06:12.400
Thank you. Thank you.

06:12.554 --> 06:14.549
This is literally
the best day of my life!

06:14.742 --> 06:17.506
You did this. Four A's and a B.
I told you I'd get it for you.

06:17.661 --> 06:19.082
I never got grades like that.

06:19.235 --> 06:20.579
[Riley exhales happily]

06:20.770 --> 06:22.154
A deal's a deal.

06:22.306 --> 06:23.727
I did get lucky with these
seats though, didn't I?

06:23.882 --> 06:25.034
I know, I know.

06:25.647 --> 06:26.531

[music continues]

06:53.104 --> 06:54.986
[people cheering]

07:04.932 --> 07:07.121
So, what does "crispy" mean?

07:07.312 --> 07:08.657
It means something is good.

07:08.887 --> 07:09.925
Use it in a sentence.

07:10.692 --> 07:12.765
Dude, your house is crispy.

07:13.572 --> 07:14.570
I see.

07:15.877 --> 07:18.795
So if I were to come
to somebody's house and say,

07:18.948 --> 07:21.599
"Yo, your house is extra fried."

07:21.828 --> 07:22.904
Don't ever say that.

07:23.134 --> 07:24.440
Why? Extra fried is better
than crispy.

Stop. I'm not teaching you
any more words.

You can either stay in the seat

09:22.600 --> 09:23.983
or you can come with me
and wait outside the men's room.

I'm good, Dad.
I don't wanna leave.

09:26.708 --> 09:27.900
You stay in the seat.

09:28.091 --> 09:29.895
-Promise?
-I promise.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.969
Riley, I mean it.

Hi. You're here with Riley?

11:12.273 --> 11:13.079
Yep.

11:13.271 --> 11:14.923
[singsong] I'm here with Jody.

11:15.806 --> 11:17.189
-[dry chuckle]
-I haven't, uh...

11:17.342 --> 11:19.685
haven't seen you since
that whole parent-teacher...

11:19.914 --> 11:21.911
...thing. [awkward laugh]

11:22.104 --> 11:22.987
It's good to see you.

11:23.178 --> 11:25.368
Yeah.
Listen, I just really do hope

11:25.559 --> 11:27.903
that they can be friends still,
you know?

11:28.824 --> 11:29.823
You know how girls are
at this age.

11:30.014 --> 11:31.167
[gags, laughs]

11:31.358 --> 11:33.087
And I talked to Jody
and she's gonna work real hard

11:33.278 --> 11:34.737
to include Riley
in things, so...

11:35.583 --> 11:37.349
Riley was really hurt
by all this.

11:37.503 --> 11:39.807
As a dad, it's hard to see that.

11:40.306 --> 11:41.496
Right.

11:43.377 --> 11:44.492
I gotta get back to the seat.

11:44.684 --> 11:46.795
Okay. Well, just tell her
that Jody and Sarah and Sarah C.

11:46.950 --> 11:50.136
are sitting right there
in section 107,
and they'd love to see her.

11:51.096 --> 11:51.903
I'll see you soon.

11:52.555 --> 11:53.554
Yeah, good to see you.

12:23.469 --> 12:24.697
Hi.

12:26.311 --> 12:27.999
Jody and her mom are here.

12:28.231 --> 12:29.191
Where?

12:30.035 --> 12:31.149
Not near us.

12:31.916 --> 12:33.031
Forget about them.

12:34.912 --> 12:37.293
[Lady Raven]
My father left when I was seven.

12:38.253 --> 12:40.518
I held that anger
for a long time.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.669
It was who I was.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.815
And then one day,
I decided I had to forgive him,

12:48.046 --> 12:49.504
or I would never move on.

12:50.810 --> 12:53.920
I pretended like
he was in front of me,
and I said,

12:54.842 --> 12:57.531
"You are not responsible
for hurting me.

12:58.222 --> 12:59.297
I release you."

13:00.372 --> 13:01.869
Everything got better
after that.

13:02.024 --> 13:05.249
[cheers and applause]

13:05.440 --> 13:07.976
I want you to picture
someone who hurt you.

13:08.936 --> 13:10.971
I want you to try
to forgive them.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.197
Say to yourself,
"I release you."

13:13.966 --> 13:16.578
And if you feel you have,

13:16.731 --> 13:19.342
I want you to turn on the light
on your phones.

while they set up
the stage for the next song.

-Hi.
-[vendor] Hi.

15:14.891 --> 15:16.157
Um, can I get that
in a small, please?

15:16.388 --> 15:17.885
Uh, I want that too.

15:18.077 --> 15:19.768
Umm... [clicks tongue]

15:20.765 --> 15:22.071
Look,
I only have one left, ladies.

15:22.302 --> 15:24.759
I was standing here before her.
Like, forever.

15:26.104 --> 15:28.139
It's okay, Riley,
let her have it.
She really wants it.

15:28.331 --> 15:29.751
We can find another one later.

15:30.827 --> 15:31.633
-Yeah?
-Sure, Dad.

15:31.826 --> 15:33.055
Okay.

15:35.820 --> 15:38.238
You guys are good family.
Good values and stuff.

15:38.468 --> 15:39.890
Trust me, you don't see that.

15:40.043 --> 15:43.346
Listen. I'll get more soon.
I'll put one for you aside.

15:43.538 --> 15:46.226
Just come see me in like...
ten minutes. All right?

Psst!

-Cooper.
-Jamie.

16:00.819 --> 16:02.547
Hey, what's with
all the police trucks outside

16:02.739 --> 16:04.159
and the cameras everywhere,
Jamie?

16:04.389 --> 16:05.388
Something happening?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.956
I'm not supposed to tell.
Don't rat me out.

16:11.456 --> 16:12.147
I won't.

16:13.491 --> 16:15.602
You know the Butcher? Hmm?

16:15.756 --> 16:18.559
That frickin' nutjob
that goes around
just chopping people up?

16:20.479 --> 16:21.709
Yeah.

16:21.901 --> 16:24.973
Well, the feds or whatever heard
that he's gonna be here today.

16:25.779 --> 16:27.930
So they set up a trap for him.

16:28.082 --> 16:30.541
This whole concert, it's a trap.

16:30.771 --> 16:32.230
Wow. Here?

16:32.384 --> 16:34.726
Yeah. Yeah, they're
watching all the exits.

16:34.956 --> 16:36.570
They're checking everyone
that leaves.

16:36.723 --> 16:38.989
There's no way
to get out of here,
except backstage, I guess.

16:39.181 --> 16:40.870
But no one can get backstage.

16:41.025 --> 16:42.829

16:43.021 --> 16:44.865
Yeah. See?

16:45.018 --> 16:46.055
It's kinda dope, right?

16:46.246 --> 16:47.590
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.663
Don't tell anyone. I'll get--
I'll get in deep crap.

16:50.855 --> 16:51.892
No.

16:52.775 --> 16:54.465
Okay... Uh, I gotta get back.

16:54.618 --> 16:55.732
But come see me
for that T-shirt.

16:56.308 --> 16:57.958
-For sure, Jamie.
-[Jamie chuckles]

17:02.145 --> 17:04.104
[Cooper] I just heard
about this funnel cake stand.

17:04.296 --> 17:05.485
I think it's down here.

17:05.715 --> 17:07.099
I'm kinda craving it.

17:07.674 --> 17:08.595
Hold on.

17:09.748 --> 17:10.670
Let me think about where it is
for a second.

17:10.862 --> 17:11.822
[electronic beep]

17:12.053 --> 17:13.934
Come on, Dad.
It's not good for you anyway.

17:18.811 --> 17:21.114
Actually, you know what?
I think it was further back
where we were.

17:21.346 --> 17:22.344
Do you mind?

17:26.798 --> 17:28.794
[Riley]
She started the next song.
Let's get back to our seats.

17:29.026 --> 17:30.255
[Cooper] Ugh...

17:31.099 --> 17:32.251
I thought this was it.

17:32.443 --> 17:33.556
Dad, come on.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.480
[woman grunts, gasps]

17:58.286 --> 17:59.323
[scattered screams]

17:59.515 --> 18:00.745
[officer]
We got a patron injury.

18:00.899 --> 18:02.242
-[Riley] What happened?
-[Cooper sighs]

18:02.472 --> 18:04.700
I think that woman drank
too much, lost her balance.

18:06.197 --> 18:07.925
Let's clear out
and give her some space.

18:11.765 --> 18:13.916
Hey. Why don't we go outside
for a second?

18:14.147 --> 18:15.337
Then we can go back in.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.872
Why? What's going on, Dad?

18:22.902 --> 18:24.707
[indistinct radio chatter]

18:25.513 --> 18:26.858
[Lady Raven singing, muffled]

18:27.087 --> 18:28.969
Wait, isn't this
one of the songs
you always play?

18:29.199 --> 18:30.659
Mm-hm.

18:30.813 --> 18:33.386
Well, let's stop
messing around out here
and get back to our seats.

18:33.578 --> 18:35.036
[indistinct radio chatter]

18:35.268 --> 18:36.420

18:54.353 --> 18:57.579
[cheers and applause]

18:57.770 --> 18:59.651
How you all doing?
You having fun?

18:59.805 --> 19:02.494
-[crowd cheers]
-Whoo! Yeah!

19:02.647 --> 19:07.447
This next song I wrote
with a friend of mine,
Parker Wayne.

19:07.639 --> 19:09.559
[crowd cheers]

19:11.287 --> 19:14.167
Wish I could just
scream his name,
and he'd join me for this song.

19:14.359 --> 19:16.240
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

19:16.394 --> 19:20.312
Hey, maybe if we all scream
his name,

19:20.504 --> 19:21.962
he might hear us.

19:23.230 --> 19:27.378
On three,
everybody scream "Parker!"

19:27.607 --> 19:30.027
One, two, three.

19:30.219 --> 19:32.561
[crowd screaming] Parker!

[Lady Raven singing
with Parker Wayne]

20:31.776 --> 20:33.926
["Hiding" continues]

20:42.183 --> 20:44.180
Look in the stage
where that guy came out.

20:44.371 --> 20:45.446
I wonder what's down there.

20:46.753 --> 20:49.633
Hey, we should climb down
and see where it leads.

20:49.863 --> 20:51.630
It looks really cool.

20:51.783 --> 20:53.049
What?

20:53.203 --> 20:55.200
Wouldn't it be unbelievable
to see what's down there?

20:55.431 --> 20:57.120
See how they put on the show?

20:57.351 --> 20:59.156
There might be costumes
and things.

20:59.348 --> 21:01.383
That's crazy,
we can't go down there.

21:02.343 --> 21:03.419
You're acting strange.

21:03.956 --> 21:05.377
Is something wrong, Dad?

21:06.797 --> 21:07.873
No.

21:08.948 --> 21:10.792
I'm just excited for you,
is all.

21:10.945 --> 21:13.902
[Parker Wayne rapping]

21:15.745 --> 21:17.512
You're right, it's crazy.

21:17.704 --> 21:19.124
Forget your stupid dad.

21:20.084 --> 21:21.197
This concert...

21:22.004 --> 21:23.157

21:31.144 --> 21:32.987
[trapdoor mechanism clattering]

21:43.124 --> 21:45.889
I'm gonna go see if
they have that T-shirt for you
back at the stand.

21:46.081 --> 21:47.618
Oh, okay. Thanks, Dad.

21:51.382 --> 21:53.110
[laughing]
Oh, hey! Dad of the year!

21:53.340 --> 21:54.914
Hold one sec. Um... [laughs]

21:55.106 --> 21:58.102
Right. I gotta get you a, uh,
small concert tour tee.

21:58.331 --> 22:00.328
I was about to go down
to the storage closet
to get more merch.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.596
I can walk with you.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.631
Sure, sure, sure.
Um, I'll be right back, Dawn.

22:03.785 --> 22:06.011
You got this, girl.
Just hold it down. All right?

22:13.193 --> 22:14.077
Fire department.

22:14.269 --> 22:15.496
[chuckles] No shit!

22:15.688 --> 22:18.147
[sighs] Of course it's
all the way up there.

22:20.412 --> 22:21.679
[Jamie grunting]

22:21.834 --> 22:23.369
Here. Let me help you with that.

22:26.325 --> 22:29.667
[Jamie]
Bro! You're strong. [laughs]

22:30.397 --> 22:31.779
They ever find that guy?

22:32.892 --> 22:33.890
The Butcher?

22:34.082 --> 22:35.964
No, no.
I haven't heard anything lately.

22:36.157 --> 22:38.537
You know,
I'm kind of obsessed with him.

22:38.767 --> 22:40.957
I've been following him
for all 12 victims.

22:41.188 --> 22:42.877
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

22:43.069 --> 22:45.296
[music playing in distance]

22:45.488 --> 22:46.909
You're not squeamish, are you?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.945
Not too bad.

22:51.209 --> 22:53.438
Remember when they found
that woman on the bridge?

22:54.628 --> 22:57.853
Well, one of my boys
was jogging on the bridge

22:58.006 --> 22:59.467
before they covered it up.

23:00.886 --> 23:02.691
That's pieces, dawg.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.420
She's deli-prepped.

23:04.611 --> 23:07.147
Like, this dude
is next-level insane.

23:08.222 --> 23:10.256
Sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

23:11.408 --> 23:12.483
We cool?

23:13.482 --> 23:14.558
[chuckling] Yeah.

23:14.789 --> 23:17.130
[laughs] Would be dope
if they caught him today.

23:18.282 --> 23:21.240
We had a training thing.
All the employees of the arena.

23:21.432 --> 23:23.121
They gave us a code to say
in each section of the arena

23:23.275 --> 23:26.194
in case we got stopped
by the police.
Real undercover stuff.

23:26.653 --> 23:27.690
That's kinda cool.

23:27.882 --> 23:29.112
What's your code? I mean...

23:30.417 --> 23:31.839
If you can say. I don't want
you to get into trouble.

23:32.069 --> 23:34.410
[scoffs]
I mean, you're fire department,
Cooper. You're on our side.

23:34.641 --> 23:35.794
Yeah.

23:39.134 --> 23:40.401
[whispers] "Hamilton."

23:41.861 --> 23:43.128
[box cutter clicks]

Can you hold this?

23:49.349 --> 23:51.385
Oh, yeah. Ooh. There you go.

23:55.493 --> 23:56.721
Here, take the top one.

23:57.913 --> 23:59.525
-What do I owe you?
-Ah, don't worry about it.

23:59.756 --> 24:01.406
Pass it forward, as they say.

24:03.365 --> 24:04.978
-Don't forget this.
-[box cutter clicks]

24:05.208 --> 24:06.745

Black, south side
and green for the west side.

24:44.877 --> 24:46.220
Our situation:

24:46.451 --> 24:48.448
Let's keep it clear
who we're dealing with.

24:49.331 --> 24:51.174
He is a danger to everyone.

24:51.328 --> 24:53.209
This is a photo
of one of his victims,

24:53.363 --> 24:55.476
a young man who went
to the state university.

24:55.630 --> 24:57.319
He studied to become a teacher.

24:57.550 --> 24:58.816
Married.

24:59.008 --> 25:01.236
Had a two-year-old son.
Took care of his parents.

25:02.925 --> 25:06.075
He was awarded
the "Most Liked Teacher"
at his school where he works.

25:07.188 --> 25:08.878
These are the people
who should win.

25:10.145 --> 25:11.988
Remember what the profiler said.

25:12.218 --> 25:14.561
If we get into a confrontation
with our unsub,

25:14.753 --> 25:16.597
our job is to get him alone,

25:16.789 --> 25:18.900
away from civilians
as quickly as possible.

25:19.130 --> 25:23.661
I will personally take
the team member who brings
this freak down out to dinner.

25:23.853 --> 25:24.660
-Let's go. Get to work.
-[electronic beep]

25:24.890 --> 25:26.120
-[man] There was no trouble?
-No, no.

Let's run down our SMEAC.

Situation, blind spot
on northeast corner
of the stadium...

25:30.959 --> 25:32.264
Sorry, guys.

Just gotta...
check the coffee, okay?

of the concourse.

25:43.975 --> 25:45.512
[Cooper sighs]

25:46.894 --> 25:49.084
We think our unsub was spotted
on the top concourse.

25:49.276 --> 25:52.117
There is a stairwell
in the southwest corner.
We can use that.

25:52.309 --> 25:53.961
Now, this is my concern.

25:54.191 --> 25:56.725
The safety
of the general public,
the staff...

...to the side, so there is
a service elevator...

26:05.019 --> 26:06.403
Where do you guys keep
the sugar?

26:07.708 --> 26:10.243
Barrett was supposed
to refill that. One second.

26:11.739 --> 26:13.315
Here, you can use my stash.

26:13.545 --> 26:14.505
Thanks.

26:16.349 --> 26:17.576
-You guys want donuts?
-No.

26:18.345 --> 26:19.496
I'll leave them out.

Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey...

26:50.525 --> 26:53.289
I'm really glad I saw you again.
I can tell that you're upset.

26:53.521 --> 26:55.326
I am upset.
My daughter was hurt.

26:55.479 --> 26:56.976
-We can talk about it later.
-No, no, no.

26:57.206 --> 26:58.704
These girls just need
to be able to work things out
for themselves.

26:58.934 --> 27:00.854
-You know what I'm saying?
-To an extent, I do.

27:01.086 --> 27:02.966
But it's delicate.
Let's discuss it later.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.273
No. Hey!

27:05.924 --> 27:07.115
Don't mess with me, Cooper.

27:08.036 --> 27:09.456
I'm not someone to be provoked.

27:09.687 --> 27:12.413
I have a dark side.
You don't want to see it.

27:12.567 --> 27:15.216
Look... This is their day.

27:15.447 --> 27:17.136
Riley's been looking forward
to this for six months.

27:17.328 --> 27:18.750
-Let's just have fun, okay?
-Okay.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.900
Don't patronize me, Cooper.

27:21.092 --> 27:22.245

Get him out of here, quickly.

28:04.870 --> 28:07.019
What was that? A scalper?

28:07.211 --> 28:08.479
[Cooper] How about this?

28:08.671 --> 28:10.053
Why don't we get
the girls to get
a slice of pizza together?

28:10.476 --> 28:12.435
One p.m., Saturday at Carmine's?

28:12.588 --> 28:13.663
[stammers] Wait, what?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.659
Just so they have
a positive experience.

28:15.851 --> 28:17.043
We don't need them
to be best friends.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.846
They just need to coexist.
Not see each other as threats.

28:20.077 --> 28:22.035
-Sound like a plan?
-I'll ask Jody.

28:22.226 --> 28:23.840
Thank you.
I'm gonna get back to Riley.

28:24.032 --> 28:25.298
Enjoy the rest of the concert.

28:25.490 --> 28:26.412
You too.

anybody to know about it.

45:02.189 --> 45:04.492
[crowd roaring]

45:15.245 --> 45:20.122
[crowd chanting] Lady Raven!
Lady Raven! Lady Raven!

45:32.104 --> 45:33.332
[inhaling deeply]

45:38.324 --> 45:39.707
[man] I don't understand.
I don't understand it.

45:39.899 --> 45:41.012
I said Lactaid milk.

45:41.242 --> 45:43.047
Lactaid milk, not whole milk.

45:43.239 --> 45:45.429
You won't stop until I doo-doo
on myself, now, will you?

45:45.583 --> 45:46.389
Will you?

45:47.618 --> 45:49.307
Everyone needs a break
when they're starting out.

45:49.499 --> 45:50.421
[loud cheering]

45:50.651 --> 45:54.376
And I got mine
from the dopest person ever.

45:54.529 --> 45:56.988
I owe a lot to The Thinker.

45:57.218 --> 46:00.443
[melodic guitar riff playing]

46:05.666 --> 46:08.546
[Lady Raven performing "Divine"]

46:25.635 --> 46:28.553
[The Thinker joins in]

46:57.929 --> 46:59.004
Hey, when this is over,

46:59.158 --> 47:01.040
can we go out the back here
to get to our car?

47:01.271 --> 47:02.998
Oh, yeah.
That's fine. No worries.

47:03.153 --> 47:04.343
-Thanks.
-Sure.

47:04.534 --> 47:07.414
[Lady Raven continues performing
"Divine"]

47:20.931 --> 47:23.773
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

47:25.923 --> 47:27.651
I'll see you tonight, yeah?
All right.

47:32.375 --> 47:33.527
How you doin'?

47:34.679 --> 47:37.559
[laughter and chatter]

47:38.365 --> 47:40.209
[Cooper laughs]

47:42.590 --> 47:44.434
[indistinct radio chatter]

47:45.239 --> 47:46.277
Oh, my God.

47:46.469 --> 47:48.042
[fans exclaiming]

47:49.079 --> 47:50.999
[indistinct radio chatter]

47:54.111 --> 47:55.415
Dad, look, look!

47:57.106 --> 47:59.256
[woman] Mr. The Thinker,
I got that kombucha
just like you asked.

47:59.448 --> 48:00.869
No, that's feral fig.

48:01.061 --> 48:03.596
I specifically said I wanted
honeysuckle sour kombucha,
bitch.

48:03.826 --> 48:05.976
[stammering] Of course you did.
I can fix that.

48:06.206 --> 48:07.857
-Knock on the door.
-Yes.

48:08.049 --> 48:09.777
Knock harder. Damn!

48:10.891 --> 48:12.428
-Hey!
-Hi!

48:13.503 --> 48:15.039
-You killed it.
-Thank you. Great show.

48:15.231 --> 48:17.496
Thank you. You too, you too.
Going back to LA?

48:17.726 --> 48:18.533
Yeah. See you there.

48:18.686 --> 48:21.298
-Yeah. DM me. Bye.
-All right. Bye.

48:21.490 --> 48:23.256
[indistinct chatter]

48:25.100 --> 48:26.367
[Riley gasps]

48:35.392 --> 48:36.621
[The Thinker] Hot zaddy!

48:36.773 --> 48:40.000
[laughs] Oww!

48:40.192 --> 48:41.804
[Dr. Grant over radio]
<i> All male stadium employees</i>

48:42.035 --> 48:44.032
<i> should be run</i>
<i> through the system again.</i>

48:44.262 --> 48:47.334
<i> We will stop every male</i>
<i> in attendance at this concert.</i>

48:48.103 --> 48:49.715
One of you is going
to be talking to the Butcher

48:49.869 --> 48:52.019
in the next 20 minutes.

48:52.211 --> 48:54.131
You may count on it.

48:54.361 --> 48:55.514
[radio beeps]

48:56.281 --> 48:58.777
[excited chatter, cheers]

48:59.007 --> 49:01.004
Hey. All right,
she wants to say bye

49:01.197 --> 49:02.732
and thank you to you guys.
She's just got to get done

49:02.924 --> 49:04.077
some radio
meet and greets, okay?

49:04.308 --> 49:05.345
-All right.
-This is some concert gear

49:05.574 --> 49:06.688
-for you guys.
-Thank you.

49:06.841 --> 49:08.071
[chuckles] You're welcome.

49:08.301 --> 49:09.606
And thank you again
for all of your help.

49:09.838 --> 49:11.066
Of course.

49:11.257 --> 49:12.948
All right, so you guys are
gonna go out the back way.

49:14.368 --> 49:15.828
Uh...

49:16.019 --> 49:17.441
Yeah. Okay,
so you're gonna go through
a police inspection there.

49:17.633 --> 49:19.130
They'll ask you some questions.
It's nothing.

49:19.322 --> 49:20.705
We just have
some extra security tonight.

49:21.933 --> 49:23.085
It's a pain in the butt,
but we've all gotta do it.

49:23.239 --> 49:25.658
Only Lady Raven and her
very close group are excluded.

49:25.850 --> 49:27.195
And you were
so great tonight, angel.

49:27.387 --> 49:28.385
She'll be out soon, okay?

49:28.576 --> 49:29.921
-Okay.
-Okay!

49:32.955 --> 49:35.527
[Riley] Oh, my gosh, Dad,
there's so much stuff in here.

49:35.720 --> 49:36.757
Look!

49:37.985 --> 49:40.173
Oh, my gosh, Dad,
there's so much in here.

49:40.327 --> 49:41.902
Dad, there's tattoos.

49:42.938 --> 49:45.012
Dad, there's
three drink bottles.

49:45.204 --> 49:46.703
Oh, there's two white ones.
We'd be matching.

49:46.855 --> 49:48.469
Do you want one?
We could be matching, Dad.

49:48.623 --> 49:49.697
Yeah. Great.

49:50.351 --> 49:51.886
[Riley] Oh, this is so cool.

49:54.152 --> 49:55.649
There's no sign of him at all?

49:55.803 --> 49:57.454
He's playing his hand very well.

49:57.646 --> 49:59.720
But this is an inevitability.

49:59.951 --> 50:03.561
There were 20,642
in attendance today.

50:03.791 --> 50:06.132
There were 3,000 men here.

50:06.324 --> 50:08.629
We will have photos and data
on all of them.

50:08.821 --> 50:11.356
We're questioning everyone
as they leave.

50:11.548 --> 50:13.621
He is one of those 3,000.

50:14.313 --> 50:15.579
We will catch him.

50:18.613 --> 50:20.035
He's out of moves.

50:20.265 --> 50:21.839
I'll give you an update soon.

50:23.107 --> 50:25.027
[tense music playing]

50:33.167 --> 50:34.204
Riley!

50:35.433 --> 50:37.161
-Did you have fun up there?
-Yes.

50:37.967 --> 50:39.043
That's so amazing.

50:39.657 --> 50:40.847
[Riley laughs nervously]

50:41.040 --> 50:43.381
Thank you. My dad got it for me.
It's an antique.

50:45.840 --> 50:48.144
Hey. I think you heard
about my daughter's condition?

50:48.297 --> 50:49.603
Can I talk to you alone
for a moment?

50:49.795 --> 50:51.100
Just for like one minute?

50:51.792 --> 50:53.135
Of course.

50:53.289 --> 50:54.557
I'm gonna talk
to your dad for a second.

50:54.711 --> 50:55.517
BRB.

50:55.977 --> 50:57.476
We'll leave soon, honey.

50:58.857 --> 50:59.971
[Lady Raven] Wait outside.
Just give me a second.

51:00.164 --> 51:01.431
I'll leave right after.

51:05.539 --> 51:07.728
[Cooper laughs]

51:08.919 --> 51:10.416
Thank you for everything
you've done for Riley.

51:10.608 --> 51:11.684
She's an angel.

51:11.876 --> 51:13.411
I feel so close to her.
I don't know why.

51:13.565 --> 51:14.833
She really is special.

51:14.986 --> 51:16.561
[Cooper inhales deeply]

51:16.753 --> 51:19.671
I don't know if you know
anything about carbon monoxide.

51:21.130 --> 51:24.548
Your body wants the poison.
It wants it more than oxygen.

51:24.739 --> 51:27.811
That's why it can be
so very lethal in small spaces.

51:27.965 --> 51:29.731
You need to know about these
sort of things as a firefighter.

51:29.885 --> 51:31.883
-[laughs]
-I'm sorry?

51:33.533 --> 51:36.221
Well... the reason I wanted
to talk to you...

51:38.295 --> 51:39.293
is...

51:40.869 --> 51:42.405
...I think you're
looking for me.

51:45.515 --> 51:47.050
I mean, all of you.

51:49.394 --> 51:50.200
Hold on.

51:51.850 --> 51:53.963
Oh, wait, I gotta press mute
so he doesn't hear us.

51:56.191 --> 52:00.222
[shaky breaths, groaning]

52:01.412 --> 52:02.872
<i> Help!</i>

52:03.026 --> 52:04.446
[Cooper] Yep.

52:06.942 --> 52:08.171
You see that little box?

52:09.362 --> 52:10.322
That is going to release
carbon monoxide...

52:10.514 --> 52:11.398
<i> Help me!</i>

52:11.590 --> 52:12.779
...and kill him
within five minutes.

52:12.933 --> 52:14.776
He is going to die
if I am caught.

52:15.006 --> 52:16.696
That's just an absolute fact.

52:17.848 --> 52:19.116
I can do it from here,
from this device,

52:19.347 --> 52:21.151
like... [chuckles]
...calling an Uber.

52:22.379 --> 52:24.031
You caught me. I admit it.

52:24.761 --> 52:27.103
But... you can save him.

52:28.908 --> 52:31.443
I'll let him go
if you do one thing.

52:32.710 --> 52:34.168
What you're going to do
in front of everybody

52:34.361 --> 52:35.552
is you're going to ask
me and my daughter

52:35.743 --> 52:37.624
if we want a ride
in your limousine.

52:38.776 --> 52:40.275
And then you're gonna
drive us out of here.

52:41.503 --> 52:44.115
I will press it right now
if you signal them.

52:46.842 --> 52:49.490
Save him. Catch me.

52:50.643 --> 52:52.679
Save him. Catch me.

52:53.562 --> 52:54.905
By the way, it was a great show.

52:57.094 --> 52:58.631
His name is Spencer.

52:58.822 --> 53:00.205
He's 22 years old.

53:01.165 --> 53:02.432
He's into
sustainable agriculture.

53:02.662 --> 53:04.928
[Spencer]
<i> Somebody help me, please!</i>

53:06.042 --> 53:07.808
<i> Please help me!</i>

53:08.845 --> 53:10.036
<i> Help!</i>

[indistinct radio chatter]

53:23.936 --> 53:25.473
[Cooper laughs]

53:25.664 --> 53:26.816
Whoa.

53:30.043 --> 53:31.848
Right through here.
Right this way.

53:32.040 --> 53:33.000
Move along.

53:33.230 --> 53:34.343
-Through here.
-All right.

53:35.112 --> 53:37.032
[Riley gasps excitedly]

53:39.412 --> 53:40.757
These three are cleared.

53:43.981 --> 53:46.746
[indistinct chatter]

53:58.612 --> 53:59.765
[limousine engine starts]

54:01.877 --> 54:03.105
[officer] To your left.

54:03.297 --> 54:04.449
Everybody forward.

54:05.294 --> 54:06.793
Through.
Right through here, sir.

54:08.136 --> 54:09.596
Through here. Exit through here.

54:09.749 --> 54:11.822
-Get out, let's go.
-[officer 2] Let's just
move along.

54:28.681 --> 54:29.986
Limo's clear.

54:51.645 --> 54:53.142
You can just drop us off
on the near corner.

54:53.334 --> 54:54.448
We're parked nearby.

55:08.964 --> 55:10.345
[Riley sighs happily]

55:11.229 --> 55:13.341
-Um, can I...?
-Yeah.

55:18.679 --> 55:20.022
-Hey, Riley.
-Mm-hm?

55:20.791 --> 55:21.904
Can I visit your home?

55:22.787 --> 55:24.171
-What?
-Yeah.

55:24.363 --> 55:25.476
How about right now?

55:26.244 --> 55:27.127
I could drop you there.

55:28.395 --> 55:30.276
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
this isn't happening.

55:30.467 --> 55:31.466
Is this happening?

55:31.619 --> 55:33.963
Oh, my God, that would be,
like, so incredible.

55:34.155 --> 55:35.038
Oh, my God!

55:35.229 --> 55:36.612
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

55:36.805 --> 55:38.648
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

55:39.492 --> 55:41.643
Mom. Mom, you won't believe it.
You will not believe it.

55:41.835 --> 55:44.523
Me and Dad are in a limousine,
and we're here with Lady Raven.

55:45.522 --> 55:47.095
No, I'm not making it up.
I'm not making it up.

55:47.288 --> 55:49.092
I got picked
to be the Dreamer Girl onstage,

55:49.246 --> 55:52.127
and then she asked
to drop us off and now she wants
to see our house.

55:53.470 --> 55:55.199
Yeah, I know, I know.
Dad can't believe it either.

55:55.390 --> 55:56.850
He's just sitting there.

55:57.042 --> 55:58.732
Can she come? Mom, come on.

55:58.924 --> 56:00.190
She doesn't care
about the carpet.

56:00.690 --> 56:02.802
Mom, please. Please? Say yes.

56:04.876 --> 56:06.065
Mom said yes. Mom said yes!
[laughs]

56:06.257 --> 56:07.102
-Great.
-Thank you.

56:07.332 --> 56:08.100
Huh.

56:09.407 --> 56:11.673
Jeremiah. We're gonna be
visiting a friend's house.

56:11.825 --> 56:12.556
[beeps]

56:12.747 --> 56:13.516
What's the address, sweetheart?

56:13.745 --> 56:15.398
108 Monk Road.

56:15.896 --> 56:17.010
Mm-hm.

56:46.386 --> 56:47.653
[Riley giggles]

56:47.846 --> 56:51.455
[all laughing excitedly]

56:51.687 --> 56:53.607
-Oh...
-[laughter]

56:54.605 --> 56:55.910
-Dad's acting strange.
-How?

56:56.140 --> 56:57.293
Oh, I'll tell you later.

57:01.325 --> 57:02.170
Just wait here.

57:03.092 --> 57:04.436
[door shuts]

57:08.314 --> 57:09.082
[Riley] Um...

57:10.234 --> 57:12.730
This is Lady Raven.
She's... my friend.

57:13.421 --> 57:15.456
-Pleasure to meet you.
-It's an honor to meet you.

57:15.687 --> 57:17.569
We feel like
we already know you. [laughs]

57:18.144 --> 57:18.912
My name is Rachel.

57:19.065 --> 57:20.334
Thank you for letting me visit.

57:20.526 --> 57:22.638
I just got to know
your daughter.
I think she's wonderful.

57:23.174 --> 57:24.481
She is.

57:24.635 --> 57:25.632
And this is Logan.

57:25.862 --> 57:26.707
Hi, Logan.

57:26.861 --> 57:28.052
I saw you on TV.

57:28.244 --> 57:29.972
-You did?
-Wow.

57:30.203 --> 57:31.201
Well, let's not stay out here.

57:31.392 --> 57:32.929
Come in, if you can.
Have a bite.

57:34.043 --> 57:35.963
-That sounds great.
-Come.

57:41.569 --> 57:42.875
[Rachel] Lady R-Raven?

57:43.066 --> 57:45.101
Um... [laughs]
I just made a couple things.

57:45.255 --> 57:46.600
Nothing fancy
like you're used to.

57:46.829 --> 57:49.595
I would have made more
if I had more things.

57:49.748 --> 57:51.285
I love everything. I can't wait.

57:52.130 --> 57:53.857
-Can I show you my room?
-Of course.

57:54.088 --> 57:55.470
Logan, help me clean!

58:11.484 --> 58:13.633
I'll kill young Spencer if you
say anything in front of them.

58:15.094 --> 58:17.206
If you send a text
or if the police show up,
I'll kill him.

58:18.433 --> 58:20.239
I think you know
I'm not bluffing.

58:21.276 --> 58:22.581
I'm in control.

58:24.424 --> 58:26.575
I don't know
what you think you're doing.

58:27.419 --> 58:29.263
[Lady Raven]
I won't do anything.

58:29.416 --> 58:31.106
[Cooper] Okay.

58:34.332 --> 58:36.021
[Rachel] I made the pie
to celebrate Riley.

58:36.214 --> 58:37.597
She got a wonderful report card.

58:38.671 --> 58:40.668
Is it fluffy?
It's a Martha Stewart recipe.

58:41.168 --> 58:43.088
Perfect. Just the right amount.

58:44.009 --> 58:44.777
I love your necklace.

58:46.083 --> 58:49.770
Cooper got it for me on sale.
He's good at finding bargains.

58:49.923 --> 58:51.190
Always comes home
with something special.

58:51.343 --> 58:52.496
[laughs]

58:52.650 --> 58:54.455
What's it like to do a concert?

58:54.685 --> 58:57.794
I'm a theater teacher
for the fifth graders.

58:57.986 --> 58:59.830
It must be so much work,
I can't even imagine.

58:59.983 --> 59:00.867
[laughs]

59:01.097 --> 59:02.787
It was actually
very strange today.

59:03.017 --> 59:04.783
Not like a normal concert day.

59:05.245 --> 59:06.857
Oh, really? Why is that?

59:10.237 --> 59:11.697
[sets down plate]

59:11.889 --> 59:14.001
Do you know
who the Butcher is, Rachel?

59:14.884 --> 59:16.073
The Butcher?

59:16.881 --> 59:18.570
Um... [stammers]

59:18.762 --> 59:22.641
You mean, crazy person
who does that to people? I--

59:23.715 --> 59:25.981
Yes, I've heard of him. Uh...

59:27.172 --> 59:29.169
He's a monster.
That's all I can say.

59:29.399 --> 59:31.012
My friends
and I have had nightmares.

59:31.818 --> 59:33.278
Well, apparently,
he made a mistake.

59:34.544 --> 59:37.003
About two weeks ago,
the FBI and police came to me

59:37.232 --> 59:38.769
and they told me
they had found out

59:39.000 --> 59:41.303
he was gonna be
at my concert today.

59:41.496 --> 59:43.493
They found a portion
of a receipt for a ticket.

59:44.606 --> 59:46.296
They found it
in one of his fake houses,

59:46.488 --> 59:48.408
they're fairly certain are his.

59:49.560 --> 59:51.556
For some reason,
he bought tickets to my concert.

59:52.286 --> 59:53.170
We had no idea why.

59:53.362 --> 59:54.628
Most of my fans
are teenage girls.

59:54.820 --> 59:57.125
My God. Well, did you catch him?

59:57.662 --> 59:58.545
Not yet.

59:59.659 --> 01:00:01.080
Did they tell you
anything about him?

01:00:01.579 --> 01:00:02.808
They did.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.148
They said he was probably a man
in his 30s or early 40s.

01:00:06.802 --> 01:00:07.724
White.

01:00:07.915 --> 01:00:09.644
Who probably has
a position of authority.

01:00:09.835 --> 01:00:11.257
So interesting.

01:00:11.449 --> 01:00:13.599
They even know
he drives a dark-colored car.

01:00:14.213 --> 01:00:15.825
They have photos of his car?

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:17.515
No. You know, from the precision

01:00:17.707 --> 01:00:19.359
of the crime scenes
and fake houses,

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.894
he's what's called
an organized offender.

01:00:22.047 --> 01:00:23.544
Probably OCD.

01:00:23.699 --> 01:00:25.119
Those individuals
always drive dark cars

01:00:25.272 --> 01:00:26.579
because they appear cleaner.

01:00:26.771 --> 01:00:29.304
Wow. [laughs]
They're so smart.

01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:31.532
They've sure learned a lot
about him.

01:00:31.724 --> 01:00:33.259
[Rachel] Yeah, I had no idea
they knew all this.

01:00:33.414 --> 01:00:35.986
He was a man who had
a scarring relationship
with his mother.

01:00:36.139 --> 01:00:37.944
She was probably
the first person to sense
he was different.

01:00:38.137 --> 01:00:39.520
What a stressful day
you must have had.

01:00:39.711 --> 01:00:41.939
-You must be tired.
-[Rachel] Oh, that's true.

01:00:42.131 --> 01:00:44.664
Don't feel like you have
to stay here to be polite.

01:00:44.819 --> 01:00:46.585
You've been
so incredibly kind to Riley.

01:00:46.778 --> 01:00:48.466
Let me walk you to the door.

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:50.925
I could play a quick song.

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:55.571
-Oh, my God.
-On our piano?

01:00:55.802 --> 01:00:58.066
[Riley moans excitedly]

01:00:58.220 --> 01:00:59.411
[excited chatter]

01:00:59.603 --> 01:01:01.370
[Riley] She's not gonna do it.

01:01:01.562 --> 01:01:05.095
[excited laughter]

01:01:06.783 --> 01:01:08.665
[laughter continues]

01:01:14.618 --> 01:01:16.192
You've all been so kind to me.

01:01:16.384 --> 01:01:18.035
One last song before I go.

01:01:18.766 --> 01:01:20.877
Riley, come sit with me.

01:01:21.069 --> 01:01:22.490
Riley, come on, baby.

01:01:31.629 --> 01:01:33.434
[plays lilting piano melody]

01:01:33.587 --> 01:01:36.391
[Rachel gasps]
Riley plays this one
all the time.

01:01:42.459 --> 01:01:44.801
<i> â™ª I used to be â™ª</i>

01:01:46.414 --> 01:01:49.985

Shall we take a selfie?

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.235
-Yeah. Um...
-[Rachel laughing]

01:03:15.427 --> 01:03:16.887
Has anyone seen my phone?

01:03:17.655 --> 01:03:18.884
Use your dad's phone.

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.995
[camera shutter clicking]

01:03:21.187 --> 01:03:22.378
Can I have
my phone back, please?

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:25.374
I have to go to the bathroom.
Where is it?

01:03:25.604 --> 01:03:26.794
Oh, right back here.

01:03:27.024 --> 01:03:28.139
I need my phone back now.

01:03:28.292 --> 01:03:29.635
-[Rachel] Cooper?
-I need my phone.

01:03:29.827 --> 01:03:30.480
[Riley] Dad.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.707
[Rachel]
What are you doing, Cooper?

01:03:32.939 --> 01:03:33.822
[Cooper] Give me my phone.

01:03:34.014 --> 01:03:34.820
[Riley]
Dad, why are you so upset?

01:03:35.819 --> 01:03:37.431
[Rachel] Cooper, I need you
to step away from the door.

01:03:37.584 --> 01:03:38.814
[sniffles] Hello?

01:03:39.044 --> 01:03:41.040

<i> -Hello?</i>
-[banging on door]

01:03:42.999 --> 01:03:44.074
[Rachel] Stop it!
Cooper, you're scaring the kids.

01:03:44.266 --> 01:03:45.111
[Cooper] Sit down.

01:03:45.264 --> 01:03:46.417
[Logan]
Dad, why are you so angry?

01:03:46.571 --> 01:03:47.454
-[banging on door]
-[Logan] You're acting weird.

01:03:47.646 --> 01:03:48.874
[Cooper]
Kids, go up to your room. Now!

01:03:49.066 --> 01:03:50.794
-Can you hear me?
<i> -Yes.</i>

01:03:50.986 --> 01:03:52.984
-Where are you?
<i> -I don't know.</i>

01:03:53.751 --> 01:03:54.788
Are you in a house?

01:03:55.019 --> 01:03:56.018
<i> Yes, he had my head covered.</i>

01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:57.784
<i> I could only peek out</i>

01:03:59.626 --> 01:04:01.010
-[Cooper] Open the door, please.
-[Riley] Dad.

01:04:02.085 --> 01:04:04.427
<i> He asked me</i>
<i> to help jump his car.</i>

01:04:04.658 --> 01:04:05.464
-[Cooper] Right now.
-[banging on door]

01:04:05.656 --> 01:04:06.885
[Rachel] Cooper!

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.728
<i> There's a table, with knives</i>
<i> and cleavers and things.</i>

01:04:09.535 --> 01:04:11.455
-Is your name Spencer?
<i> -It is.</i>

01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.145
We don't have much time.

01:04:13.337 --> 01:04:15.678
Tell me anything you remember
to help me find you.

01:04:15.832 --> 01:04:17.100
Anything distinct.

[stammers]
<i> There was a broken lion.</i>

01:04:19.633 --> 01:04:21.630
<i> We stopped at a light,</i>
<i> and I saw the shape of a lion.</i>

01:04:21.823 --> 01:04:23.820
<i>-Something was broken off of it.</i>
-Like a statue?

01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:26.047
<i> Less than a minute</i>
<i>before we pulled into the house.</i>

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.812
<i> And the door was blue.</i>
<i>The door of the house was blue.</i>

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:30.617
<i>I saw it in the rearview mirror</i>
<i> as he backed up.</i>

01:04:30.847 --> 01:04:31.692
[Cooper] Where is the master key
for the bathroom?

01:04:31.846 --> 01:04:32.997
[Rachel]
Have you lost your mind?

01:04:33.189 --> 01:04:33.995
-[Riley] Dad, stop it.
-[banging on door]

01:04:34.226 --> 01:04:34.802
[Cooper]
You shouldn't have done this.

01:04:35.032 --> 01:04:36.185
[Rachel] Done what?

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:38.451
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna try to get you help.

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:39.986
[Cooper] Who are you talking to?

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.599
[Rachel] Please step away from--

01:04:41.752 --> 01:04:43.251
[Riley] You're acting weird.

01:04:43.442 --> 01:04:44.479
Please, Dad. Please.

01:04:45.439 --> 01:04:46.861
[Rachel] You're scaring Riley.

01:04:48.089 --> 01:04:49.471

I need help here.
I need it right now.

There's a young man
named Spencer, in a basement.

01:04:56.191 --> 01:04:57.690
He needs us to find him.

This is not a joke.

live near a statue
of a broken lion?

01:05:08.288 --> 01:05:11.168 line:20%
It must be an entrance
to a building or a park.

01:05:11.398 --> 01:05:12.588 line:20%

Of those people who answered,

01:05:17.812 --> 01:05:19.502
does anyone live
on a street nearby

01:05:19.655 --> 01:05:22.266
where there is
a blue door on a house

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.186
somewhere in your neighborhood?

To the girl who just answered,
there's only a few minutes.

01:05:42.311 --> 01:05:45.037
Get your family and other adults
and go there right now.

01:05:45.229 --> 01:05:46.919
There is a young man
in a basement.

[Rachel]
Cooper, would you please
just step away from the door?

01:06:08.001 --> 01:06:09.883
-[indistinct arguing]
-[Cooper] Sit down, Rachel.

01:06:10.113 --> 01:06:11.228
[Rachel]
Cooper, slow down, okay?

01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:14.798
Rachel, listen to me.
Your husband is the Butcher.

01:06:15.028 --> 01:06:16.872
Cooper is the Butcher.

[distant heavy footsteps]

01:06:38.377 --> 01:06:40.374
[footsteps approach]

01:06:41.717 --> 01:06:46.325
-[thudding, footsteps nearing]
-[keys jingling]

01:06:46.556 --> 01:06:50.089
[door rattling]

01:06:50.281 --> 01:06:51.587
[lock clicks]

01:06:52.816 --> 01:06:54.121
[door thuds]

01:06:56.464 --> 01:06:58.384
[sighs angrily]

01:07:00.496 --> 01:07:01.762
[exhales]

01:07:09.136 --> 01:07:11.056
[inhales, exhales slowly]

01:07:14.243 --> 01:07:16.240
May I have my phone?

01:07:19.081 --> 01:07:20.503
And the rest
of the phones you have?

01:07:20.695 --> 01:07:22.883
[inhales]
Yours, Riley's, I assume.

01:07:26.455 --> 01:07:27.990
What did you do
with your family?

01:07:28.643 --> 01:07:29.910
Who were you talking to?

01:07:31.677 --> 01:07:32.483
Spencer.

01:07:33.137 --> 01:07:34.174
Oh...

01:07:34.403 --> 01:07:35.864
What'd you say to him?

01:07:38.474 --> 01:07:40.163
[tense music playing]

01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:58.904
How did you do that?

01:07:59.979 --> 01:08:04.011
[tense music continues]

01:08:07.044 --> 01:08:08.428
We're leaving.

01:08:11.346 --> 01:08:12.498
We're leaving.

01:08:13.995 --> 01:08:15.032
It is important that my hand

01:08:15.186 --> 01:08:17.298
stays on your shoulder
at all times.

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.900
Go to the far wall, please.

01:08:29.432 --> 01:08:30.662
You're doing great.

01:08:30.892 --> 01:08:34.425
I'm sensing very little
resistance in your shoulder.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.688
Let's go to the car.

01:08:37.919 --> 01:08:39.800
[Lady Raven breathes shakily]

01:08:40.607 --> 01:08:41.835
This is Rachel's car.

01:08:42.067 --> 01:08:43.717
They were right about my car.

01:08:44.447 --> 01:08:45.599
It's aurora black.

01:08:46.712 --> 01:08:48.749
I'm sensing
something in your shoulder.

01:08:49.516 --> 01:08:51.090
I would not consider that.

01:09:07.603 --> 01:09:09.523
[bag unzipping]

01:09:10.983 --> 01:09:12.980
Put these on, please.
I'd really appreciate it.

01:09:17.164 --> 01:09:20.313
[firmly] Cooper...
you listen to me now.

01:09:20.966 --> 01:09:23.233
Enough of this foolishness.

01:09:23.386 --> 01:09:27.303
You're gonna sit in your seat
or you're gonna be punished.

01:09:28.071 --> 01:09:30.682
[tense music playing]

01:09:30.913 --> 01:09:33.217
Come on.
I know what you're doing.

01:09:34.368 --> 01:09:36.903
Did I tell you you could
talk back to me, Cooper?

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.897
That profiler told you things.

01:09:41.127 --> 01:09:42.587
You never listen
when you're told.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.199
I know what you're doing.

01:09:44.353 --> 01:09:46.465
There's a way
to be a good boy, Cooper.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:49.537
There's a way
to turn yourself good.

01:09:50.382 --> 01:09:51.917
Well, that's just not true.

01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:53.684
You can choose
to be good, Cooper,

01:09:53.914 --> 01:09:56.181
and make everyone proud.

01:09:56.334 --> 01:09:57.485
The way you did
when you were little.

01:09:57.677 --> 01:09:59.444
You sometimes did good things.

01:10:00.943 --> 01:10:02.863
I used to be punished a lot.

01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:05.896
I didn't know how else
to deal with you.

01:10:07.701 --> 01:10:09.889
I'll just do this one last one.

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:13.038
And then I'll kill myself.

01:10:14.036 --> 01:10:15.841
It's the only way
to stop the monster.

01:10:15.995 --> 01:10:19.260
Stop telling stories!
Monsters aren't real.

01:10:21.755 --> 01:10:23.445
Yes, they are...

01:10:23.675 --> 01:10:24.751
[sarcastically] Mom.

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:28.360
Put on the fucking ties.

01:10:28.553 --> 01:10:30.895
I have a GPS on my phone.
They know where we are.

01:10:31.048 --> 01:10:33.737
I know. We'll throw it
out the window in a mile or two.

01:10:35.042 --> 01:10:38.460
[garage door rattling]

01:10:45.372 --> 01:10:47.292
[speaking softly]
I locked them in Riley's room.

01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:50.133
There's a window
and a nearby tree.

01:10:51.324 --> 01:10:53.514
Never looked at this place
through that lens.

01:10:54.396 --> 01:10:55.932
Never let the two lives touch.

01:10:56.624 --> 01:10:58.467
What's going on, Daddy?

01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:00.732
What are you doing?

01:11:02.115 --> 01:11:03.919
[Riley cries]

01:11:22.468 --> 01:11:23.428
[car door opens]

01:11:25.117 --> 01:11:27.230
We are leaving in my car.

01:11:27.422 --> 01:11:29.610
Riley, everything
is gonna work out

01:11:29.763 --> 01:11:30.800
with those girls at school.

01:11:32.068 --> 01:11:34.294
Rachel, the water heater guy
is coming on Tuesday.

01:11:34.525 --> 01:11:35.755
Don't let him trick you
into buying a new one,

01:11:35.947 --> 01:11:37.443
-it works fine.
-[Rachel whimpers]

01:11:37.597 --> 01:11:40.093
Logan, don't forget to hand
in that science project, buddy.

01:11:45.815 --> 01:11:49.040
[distant sirens wailing]

01:11:50.347 --> 01:11:52.497
[tires screeching]

01:11:55.992 --> 01:11:57.757
Go! Go, go, go, go, go.

01:11:57.912 --> 01:11:59.755
[sirens wailing]

01:11:59.947 --> 01:12:01.290
[tires screeching]

01:12:04.478 --> 01:12:06.398
[sirens continue]

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:13.503
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:16.728
[glass clattering]

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.763

[indistinct shouting]

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.916 line:20%
Get the family and non-personnel
out of here, please.

01:12:44.108 --> 01:12:45.836 line:20%
[officer] Delta team, move!

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:52.902
[officer over radio]
<i> Neighbor spotted him</i>

01:12:53.093 --> 01:12:54.937
<i> through back kitchen window.</i>
<i> He's in back.</i>

01:12:55.129 --> 01:12:57.010
Make sure the men have
a clear line of sight

01:12:57.164 --> 01:12:58.777
into back of house and kitchen.

01:12:58.969 --> 01:12:59.852
Keep eyes on him.

01:13:00.005 --> 01:13:01.350
Move! Move! Move!

01:13:01.581 --> 01:13:02.886
-[door bangs]
-Go! Go!

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.497
[man with southern accent]
Thank you for standing by, sir.

01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:07.149
I'mma drive her on out of here.

01:13:07.379 --> 01:13:08.492
[Jeremiah] Yes, sir.

01:13:11.295 --> 01:13:12.948
-[limo starts]
-Extracting civilian asset.

01:13:13.101 --> 01:13:15.097
-Support. Support.
-Eyes open. Watch corners.

01:13:15.289 --> 01:13:16.557
What's happening?

01:13:16.749 --> 01:13:18.169
[officer]<i> There's something</i>
<i> in the kitchen closet.</i>

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.088
<i> A tunnel. It appears to lead</i>
<i> to the neighbor's yard.</i>

01:13:21.319 --> 01:13:23.239
[officer] Tell 'em to move out,
right now.

01:13:26.003 --> 01:13:27.808
[officer 2]
Perimeter SWAT member down.

01:13:28.883 --> 01:13:30.958
SWAT member
in neighbor's yard down.

-[engine shuts off]
-[car door opens]

01:13:44.858 --> 01:13:46.816

01:13:54.267 --> 01:13:55.074
[gasping]

01:13:58.529 --> 01:14:00.449
Sorry, we got interrupted.

01:14:05.519 --> 01:14:06.938
-[handcuffs rattling]
-[car door slams]

-[groans]
-[engine starts]

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.121
I have a safe place
about ten minutes from here.

01:14:13.851 --> 01:14:15.388
Luckily, it has a garage.

01:14:16.079 --> 01:14:18.114
A lot of places
have fire code violations

01:14:18.306 --> 01:14:21.148
and stay vacant for years.

01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:24.565
Wasted space, I always thought.

01:14:29.211 --> 01:14:31.093
[indistinct chatter]

01:14:32.974 --> 01:14:36.046
[Cooper] When I saw you waiting
behind the curtain on stage,

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:37.774
I got the urge.

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:40.041
It's strange
when I get the urge.

01:14:41.347 --> 01:14:44.841
I think it's when I see someone
who thinks they're whole.

01:14:45.033 --> 01:14:46.953
[car horns honking]

01:14:48.335 --> 01:14:49.795
That could never be true.

01:14:49.949 --> 01:14:51.869
Everyone's in pieces.

01:15:04.578 --> 01:15:06.077
[window clicks and whirs]

01:15:06.231 --> 01:15:07.842
Oh shit! It's Lady Raven.

01:15:07.997 --> 01:15:09.187
-[Lady Raven] Help me.
-[woman] Why?

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.260
Wait, what's going on?

01:15:11.452 --> 01:15:12.989
Call the police.

01:15:13.143 --> 01:15:15.369
[people clamoring]

01:15:21.244 --> 01:15:23.242
-[woman] Is that actually
Lady Raven?
-[man] No way!

[limousine horn honks]

01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:29.616

01:15:30.385 --> 01:15:31.114
[grunting]

01:15:31.345 --> 01:15:32.650
[handcuffs continue rattling]

01:15:32.842 --> 01:15:36.528
[pedestrians chattering]

01:15:36.721 --> 01:15:38.871

[excited chatter]

[all shouting, screaming]

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:01.643
Can you see her?

01:16:01.835 --> 01:16:05.290
[sirens blaring]

01:16:10.206 --> 01:16:13.356
[rapid footsteps approaching]

01:16:15.314 --> 01:16:19.039
[indistinct chatter]

01:16:23.109 --> 01:16:24.299
[officer] He's in the car.

01:16:25.374 --> 01:16:27.102
Move civilians away
from the vehicle.

01:16:28.331 --> 01:16:29.368
Move, move! Back, back, back.

01:16:29.561 --> 01:16:31.442
[chaotic chatter]

01:16:32.978 --> 01:16:35.781
[air hissing]

01:16:36.011 --> 01:16:37.625
[SWAT officer]
We assume you are armed.

01:16:37.816 --> 01:16:39.774
We will not come closer.

01:16:40.005 --> 01:16:41.964
Get out of the vehicle.

01:16:42.118 --> 01:16:44.000
I will not ask again.

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:52.947
-[gunfire]
-[crowd screaming]

01:17:05.197 --> 01:17:07.615

01:17:10.457 --> 01:17:13.837
[indistinct shouting]

01:17:14.068 --> 01:17:16.140
It's only a SWAT helmet
and gear propped up.

01:17:16.602 --> 01:17:17.562
He must have been
with the crowd

01:17:17.754 --> 01:17:19.405
when we pulled them
away from the limo.

01:17:19.597 --> 01:17:22.246
Check all the stores.
Do not let the crowd leave.

01:17:24.051 --> 01:17:27.162
[sirens blare]

01:17:48.167 --> 01:17:50.280
[speech not audible]

01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:14.932
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.191
They say you lecture on this.

01:18:23.266 --> 01:18:25.377
What would I hear
at one of your lectures?

01:18:28.334 --> 01:18:32.481
This individual is not
a projection of our fears.

01:18:32.635 --> 01:18:34.978
He is real,
comfortable and thriving.

01:18:35.938 --> 01:18:37.475
He doesn't set off
warning signals

01:18:37.628 --> 01:18:38.857
in our nervous system,

01:18:39.087 --> 01:18:40.891
but he is profoundly different.

01:18:42.044 --> 01:18:43.771 line:20%
A parent might have sensed this
at the beginning,

01:18:43.964 --> 01:18:46.115 line:20%
but no one else after could.

01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:52.374
Your children
are with your sister.

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.639
It's not too late
to take up our offer.

01:18:55.599 --> 01:18:57.021
We can put you
all together somewhere.

01:18:57.212 --> 01:18:58.325
No. [clears throat]

01:18:58.556 --> 01:19:00.169
I don't want
to be around people.

01:19:02.128 --> 01:19:04.854
There are two cruisers
outside, all night.

01:19:05.085 --> 01:19:06.199
Thank you.

01:19:15.184 --> 01:19:17.028
[keyboard clattering]

01:19:35.382 --> 01:19:36.342
[igniter clicking]

01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:56.542
[sighs]

01:19:58.385 --> 01:20:00.843
-[Cooper] You always do that.
-[Rachel screams, gasps]

01:20:02.071 --> 01:20:03.914
You always stand
with your left hand on your hip

01:20:04.106 --> 01:20:05.643
like it's holding you up.

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:07.717
[Rachel gasps]

01:20:07.871 --> 01:20:09.330
Cooper.

01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:12.631
It's funny how we knew
each other so well.

01:20:13.899 --> 01:20:16.204
I guess we know things
without knowing them.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:17.663
[stammers]

01:20:17.854 --> 01:20:20.044
I'm sure they've
made a mistake, Cooper.

01:20:20.197 --> 01:20:21.924
I'm sure
it's a misunderstanding.

01:20:22.577 --> 01:20:24.651
I'm not great
at a lot of things Rachel,

01:20:24.804 --> 01:20:27.454
but keeping
my two lives separate

01:20:27.684 --> 01:20:29.297
is not one of them.

01:20:29.451 --> 01:20:31.641
It's a big mix-up.
I'll tell them.

01:20:31.832 --> 01:20:32.754
[laughs nervously]

01:20:32.946 --> 01:20:35.057
When I had
a second to think about it,

01:20:36.478 --> 01:20:38.707
it kinda dawned on me
how this might have happened.

01:20:39.858 --> 01:20:42.700
Maybe the trap
wasn't set there at the concert.

01:20:43.698 --> 01:20:45.004
Maybe it was set here.

01:20:45.158 --> 01:20:46.310
I--

01:20:46.501 --> 01:20:47.845
I'm not following you.

01:20:48.498 --> 01:20:50.764
Well, maybe it kind of
dawned on you, too.

01:20:51.571 --> 01:20:55.027
The late nights, the jewelry.

01:20:56.178 --> 01:20:58.713
Maybe you thought
I was having an affair.

01:21:00.633 --> 01:21:01.938
[breathes shakily]

01:21:03.552 --> 01:21:04.512
I did.

01:21:05.855 --> 01:21:07.431
But that didn't feel right.

01:21:08.928 --> 01:21:11.731
What was it about it
that didn't feel right, Rachel?

01:21:12.845 --> 01:21:14.996
The smell of cleaning fluid
on your clothes.

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:19.372
Not the type at the firehouse,
the type you smell at hospitals.

01:21:21.255 --> 01:21:23.136
[exhales]

01:21:24.442 --> 01:21:26.400
Nothing I could have done
about that, I'm afraid.

01:21:30.471 --> 01:21:32.391
I saw you make up a lie once.

01:21:33.619 --> 01:21:34.926
To our neighbor.

01:21:35.079 --> 01:21:37.229
About why we couldn't
come to his party.

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:39.763
He sort of surprised us
at our car.

01:21:41.108 --> 01:21:44.065
You lied so convincingly...

01:21:45.139 --> 01:21:46.792
so honestly
off the top of your head

01:21:46.945 --> 01:21:48.059
right in front of me.

01:21:49.633 --> 01:21:51.936
No one would ever know
you were lying.

01:21:53.243 --> 01:21:54.394
It gave me chills.

01:21:55.009 --> 01:21:55.969
I thought...

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.233
"Where did he learn to do that?"

01:22:03.226 --> 01:22:04.686
Can I take it from here?

01:22:04.877 --> 01:22:06.414
Just to see if I got this right.

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:09.640
A small consolation prize.

01:22:11.983 --> 01:22:13.557
[metallic scrape and ring]

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:19.010
You follow me one day...
to the safe house on Brewster.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.157
The one I go to
when I just want to think, plan,

01:22:23.349 --> 01:22:24.847
not to do anything.

01:22:26.075 --> 01:22:29.724
I find it just
as comforting as the doing.

01:22:31.758 --> 01:22:35.100
And then,
if I'm guessing correctly,

01:22:35.291 --> 01:22:37.211
you went back on your own.

01:22:39.208 --> 01:22:40.361
And I broke in.

01:22:41.398 --> 01:22:42.780
But there's nothing in there,
Rachel.

01:22:42.971 --> 01:22:45.660
Just a chair and a table.

01:22:46.851 --> 01:22:48.848
And then the thought
just came to me.

01:22:49.039 --> 01:22:50.691
[breathing shakily]
I couldn't get rid of it,

01:22:50.882 --> 01:22:52.380
the feeling just kept
coming back to me.

01:22:53.187 --> 01:22:54.799
I had a receipt from your wallet

01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:56.758
when I went through it
from before.

01:22:56.988 --> 01:23:02.442
A receipt from the concert,
and I left it there.

01:23:02.634 --> 01:23:04.515
And then I found a payphone
and called the police

01:23:04.668 --> 01:23:06.165
to say that it might...

01:23:06.895 --> 01:23:08.355
that it might be...

01:23:09.622 --> 01:23:11.119
...the Butcher.

01:23:12.348 --> 01:23:14.268
I tore it so it would look
like a mistake.

01:23:15.228 --> 01:23:16.304
Your mistake.

01:23:18.108 --> 01:23:19.722
I didn't know what would happen.

01:23:19.876 --> 01:23:22.141
I just thought it would
get them closer to you.

01:23:23.523 --> 01:23:26.442
And maybe I was wrong.
Maybe they would prove that.

01:23:27.862 --> 01:23:30.781
When I went back, I saw officers
interviewing the neighbors.

01:23:32.009 --> 01:23:34.622
I didn't know how they found it
or what happened,

01:23:34.813 --> 01:23:36.695
but I never went
back there again.

01:23:39.268 --> 01:23:41.649
You're not okay, Cooper.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:44.182
I know that.

01:23:46.603 --> 01:23:48.446
We could have managed.

01:23:54.859 --> 01:23:58.046
Let's finish this, at least.

01:23:58.506 --> 01:24:00.197
Riley's pie.

01:24:01.463 --> 01:24:03.576
It was supposed to be
a celebration.

01:24:14.673 --> 01:24:16.247
Sit back down.

01:24:17.783 --> 01:24:19.397
Just for a last moment.

01:24:23.352 --> 01:24:25.004
No knives, please.

01:24:31.186 --> 01:24:34.104
[dishes clattering]

01:24:38.981 --> 01:24:40.863
[Rachel breathing shakily]

01:24:59.948 --> 01:25:01.714
This won't delay it much,
I'm afraid. [sighs]

01:25:02.522 --> 01:25:04.288
I'll eat this in five bites.

01:25:04.825 --> 01:25:05.978
I know.

01:25:14.002 --> 01:25:17.459
I feel such rage
toward you, Rachel.

01:25:18.265 --> 01:25:20.378
I've never felt this before.

01:25:23.028 --> 01:25:26.252
That's different. That's...

01:25:28.326 --> 01:25:30.708
...about being seen by them.

01:25:32.359 --> 01:25:35.929
At the end,
the way they look at me...

01:25:37.812 --> 01:25:39.271
...it strangely gives me peace.

01:25:40.499 --> 01:25:42.459
There's almost no darkness
in it at all.

01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:45.875
[fork scraping against plate]

01:25:47.373 --> 01:25:50.600
This is pure anger.

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:54.016
It's so unfamiliar.

01:25:54.247 --> 01:25:57.780
It's like it's eating me
from the inside.

01:25:58.509 --> 01:26:01.198
I feel out of control.

01:26:02.542 --> 01:26:04.500
[fork scrapes against plate]

01:26:08.379 --> 01:26:11.220
But it's why I'm angry
that's amazing.

01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:14.676
It's because I won't see
Riley and Logan again.

01:26:17.134 --> 01:26:18.479
Because of you...

01:26:20.167 --> 01:26:21.973
I won't get to see them grow up.

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.389
[voice wavering]
And that's overwhelming me.

01:26:35.797 --> 01:26:36.757
Because...

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:39.944
it's gonna end in... [sniffles]

01:26:40.137 --> 01:26:41.787
...the average way.

01:26:44.091 --> 01:26:46.357
A headline of murder-suicide.

01:26:47.356 --> 01:26:49.891

01:27:15.388 --> 01:27:16.732
[Rachel] You left it in the car.

01:27:19.843 --> 01:27:22.378
The police were too busy
trying to track you down.

01:27:26.102 --> 01:27:29.175
Is that what you used on them?

01:27:30.557 --> 01:27:32.285
Just to calm them.

01:27:34.474 --> 01:27:36.855

[Cooper's mom] It's amazing
that you are angry, son.

01:28:04.004 --> 01:28:06.423
I thought I was pretending.

01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:10.647
But I wasn't.

01:28:12.913 --> 01:28:16.100
[Cooper's mom]
Not all of you is a monster.

01:28:18.827 --> 01:28:20.017
Not all.

01:28:22.284 --> 01:28:23.780
You're my son.

01:28:24.703 --> 01:28:26.162

It's good you're...

01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:41.484
...you're stopping the monster.

01:28:43.211 --> 01:28:45.938
Let see me you one last time.

01:28:59.763 --> 01:29:01.605
I accept you.

01:29:05.138 --> 01:29:06.790
