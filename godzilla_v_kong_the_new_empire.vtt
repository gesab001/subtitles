13:56.264 --> 13:58.146
Unbelievable! What?

13:58.682 --> 13:59.835
Uh...

14:01.102 --> 14:03.444
Hi, Bernie.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.595
Ilene Andrews,
we met in Hong Kong.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.130
Oh. Oh.

14:07.207 --> 14:08.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:08.475 --> 14:10.280
Hong Kong.
Yeah, that was so long ago.

14:10.395 --> 14:12.890
So, no, God, uh, yeah.

14:12.966 --> 14:14.003
That was when
my hair was longer.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.118
You cut your hair. [chuckles]

14:15.195 --> 14:16.845
Highlights too, it's nice.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.108
I was wondering if I could get
your help with something.

14:21.914 --> 14:23.603
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

14:24.756 --> 14:26.137
Uh, sure.

14:26.214 --> 14:29.171
Sure, yeah. Of course, yeah.
Come on in, Doctor Andrews.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.861
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:30.975 --> 14:32.127
Just straight down
that hall there.

14:32.281 --> 14:33.588
To the left. Okay.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.543
Have a seat.
What can I help you with?

14:37.619 --> 14:40.384
You know,<i> mi casa es su</i> home.

14:40.499 --> 14:42.495
[Ilene] Okay, so.
The sequence on the right,

14:42.610 --> 14:44.684
this is a signal
that's been interfering

14:44.799 --> 14:45.875
with our equipment
in Hollow Earth.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.449
- Okay.
- And, uh...

14:47.602 --> 14:50.982
And these are drawings
by my daughter, Jia.

14:51.059 --> 14:54.515
And you're gonna think
that I'm completely insane.

14:54.592 --> 14:57.548
No, the patterns are the same
in the middle section.

14:57.702 --> 15:00.313
Yes. Exactly.

15:00.428 --> 15:01.963
[sighs] Thank you.

15:02.078 --> 15:03.423
Look, our analysts,

15:03.539 --> 15:04.805
they don't know
what to make of this.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.035
They're talking in circles,

15:06.188 --> 15:07.531
they're saying
"radio interference,"

15:07.646 --> 15:08.914
"coincidence," but I...

15:08.991 --> 15:10.834
I know that you think
outside of the box.

15:10.950 --> 15:13.138
[chuckles] I didn't know
who else to turn to.

15:13.253 --> 15:14.520
And they sent you
here because...?

15:14.674 --> 15:15.749
No, no one sent me.
I came here on my...

15:15.865 --> 15:16.901
You know,
that's what's ironic.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.360
You know,
Monarch wouldn't confirm

15:18.476 --> 15:20.511
my crucial part
in taking down Mechagodzilla,

15:20.626 --> 15:22.431
which cost me thousands of...

15:22.546 --> 15:24.466
hundreds of subscribers
on my blog.

15:24.581 --> 15:26.386
Oh, and the trolls...
[chuckles]

15:26.501 --> 15:27.652
the trolls online,
they question

15:27.767 --> 15:29.151
every single thing
that I put up.

15:29.266 --> 15:30.994
Especially this one troll.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.875
This one troll named
ghidorastan24.

15:32.952 --> 15:34.027
You ever heard of him?

15:34.181 --> 15:35.255
- No, I don't think I have.
- Great,

15:35.370 --> 15:36.637
because he's a trash bag,
okay?

15:36.754 --> 15:38.021
I'm more qualified
than half of those people

15:38.135 --> 15:39.402
that you have working
over there.

15:39.517 --> 15:40.939
I knew what Godzilla
was going to do

15:41.053 --> 15:42.397
before anybody
at Monarch said...

15:42.513 --> 15:45.047
Which is why I am here,
Bernie. [chuckles]

15:45.200 --> 15:47.120
I am here. Okay?

15:49.579 --> 15:51.307
Can you help me or not?

15:51.882 --> 15:52.996
That depends.

15:53.111 --> 15:55.108
Are you the new boss
down at the Mess?

15:55.223 --> 15:56.222
The what?

15:56.298 --> 15:57.641
The Monarch
Hollow Earth Station.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.408
The MHES, the Mess.

15:59.523 --> 16:00.868
Yeah, nobody calls it that.

16:00.983 --> 16:02.518
I run the Kong
research division

16:02.634 --> 16:05.206
but technically
Director Hampton is in charge

16:05.321 --> 16:07.049
- of general operations.
- Hmm.

16:07.164 --> 16:08.778
Well, Director Hampton
doesn't have a kid

16:08.854 --> 16:10.276
who can talk to Kong.

16:14.076 --> 16:15.459
You want to go
to Hollow Earth.

16:15.536 --> 16:17.072
[gasps excitedly] I'm so glad
I didn't have to say it.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.569
I thought you were never
gonna ask

16:18.684 --> 16:20.067
- but I really do need proof.
- No, I'm not asking.

16:20.144 --> 16:21.679
I mean, that would help me
with my bona fides

16:21.756 --> 16:23.178
for my blog. And I knew
that you would be the person

16:23.292 --> 16:24.752
- to help me do that.
- [cell phone buzzing]

16:24.829 --> 16:25.942
Okay. Well, if this happens,
and that is a big if,

16:26.058 --> 16:27.516
then Monarch would need,
you know,

16:27.670 --> 16:29.013
whatever you guys call it.
Final cut on anything in...

16:29.090 --> 16:30.972
[Bernie] Whoa. I'm sorry,
final cut? No, no, no.

16:31.048 --> 16:33.199
You know, that will destroy
my journalistic integrity.

16:33.276 --> 16:34.620
Shit.

16:34.736 --> 16:36.079
No really true, good
documentarian gives final cut.

16:36.155 --> 16:37.385
I could make you a producer.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.843
Okay, okay! Fine! Final cut!
Final cut! Fine!

16:38.997 --> 16:40.227
Look, something is happening
to my daughter,

16:40.380 --> 16:43.145
and I have no idea
how to fix it.

16:43.260 --> 16:44.565
You work out what's going on,

16:44.718 --> 16:45.910
and I will get you anything
that you want, okay?

16:46.025 --> 16:47.215
That is a promise.

16:47.329 --> 16:48.366
Well, anything is a lot,

16:48.481 --> 16:49.711
but that's very generous,
but I...

16:49.865 --> 16:52.514
- And we have to go. Right now.
- What?

16:52.629 --> 16:54.318
Godzilla is on the move again.

16:54.434 --> 16:56.393
[ominous music playing]

17:40.166 --> 17:42.163
[suspenseful music playing]

17:48.423 --> 17:49.804
[Ilene] Okay, listen to me.

17:49.919 --> 17:51.456
If Godzilla's on the move,
he senses a threat coming.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.838
We don't know what it is.

17:52.953 --> 17:54.067
[man on phone]
<i>And you're not concerned?</i>

17:54.183 --> 17:55.487
Of course we're concerned,
Senator.

17:55.602 --> 17:57.178
That's why we're monitoring
the situation.

17:57.255 --> 17:58.290
[Senator]<i> Monitor the fact</i>
<i>that if Godzilla heads...</i>

17:58.406 --> 17:59.673
What is it? You just...

17:59.789 --> 18:00.402
-And I am telling you,
-We have a problem!

18:00.517 --> 18:01.554
Senator...

18:01.709 --> 18:03.129
that Kong doesn't
leave Hollow Earth.

18:03.244 --> 18:07.122
Which is why Godzilla has
no reason to retaliate.

18:07.199 --> 18:08.621
[alarm blaring]

18:18.220 --> 18:19.871
- What's he doing up here?
- No idea.

18:19.987 --> 18:22.175
- Well, does Godzilla know?
- Not that we can tell.

18:22.252 --> 18:23.634
Yeah, well, it's only
a matter of time.

18:23.788 --> 18:26.630
And what happens if Godzilla
starts heading this way?

18:26.783 --> 18:28.241
Then we all run like hell.

18:28.318 --> 18:29.317
[Monarch agent]
Get up, let's go!

18:29.432 --> 18:30.892
Keep it up. Come on. Let's go.

[intriguing music playing]

20:30.042 --> 20:31.194
There she is.

20:31.924 --> 20:33.114
Trapper.

20:33.229 --> 20:35.149
Thanks for getting down here
so fast. Nice work.

20:35.304 --> 20:37.108
You are most welcome.

20:37.224 --> 20:38.414
It's not every day
you get to climb

20:38.529 --> 20:40.104
inside a 300-foot ape's mouth,
is it?

20:40.180 --> 20:42.331
Yeah. And you're sure it's
gonna be strong enough?

20:42.445 --> 20:43.405
The tooth? Yeah.

20:43.482 --> 20:44.749
That's the same
polymer composite

20:44.903 --> 20:46.438
they use on the vehicle
heat shields.

20:46.554 --> 20:47.860
[groans sadly]

20:47.975 --> 20:48.897
[Trapper]
He could chomp through

20:49.051 --> 20:50.240
the Eiffel Tower
with that thing.

20:50.355 --> 20:51.700
[chuckles] Well,
good teeth aren't gonna help

20:51.815 --> 20:53.466
if Godzilla senses
that he's up here.

20:53.582 --> 20:56.998
Well. You can't have a Titan
with a toothache,

20:57.113 --> 20:58.112
can you? [chuckles]

20:58.227 --> 20:59.457
- No.
- Don't worry.

20:59.572 --> 21:00.761
Couple of hours
he might be a bit groggy,

21:00.915 --> 21:02.413
but he'll be good to go
back down.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.256
You know, when I first heard
that you were gonna be a vet

21:04.372 --> 21:05.523
I thought no.

21:05.599 --> 21:06.906
That is way too boring

21:07.021 --> 21:08.441
- for Trapper.
- [chuckles]

21:08.556 --> 21:09.978
Then you go and become the
weirdest vet in the world.

21:10.055 --> 21:12.051
Yeah, it's basically
me and Doctor Dolittle.

21:12.128 --> 21:14.663
Except my animals are bigger.

21:14.778 --> 21:17.466
I thought finally, someone has
made him grow up.

21:17.581 --> 21:19.616
Nope. Someone tried that
back in college,

21:19.770 --> 21:22.073
- but... didn't really work.
- Oh, yeah?

21:22.188 --> 21:23.456
Yeah,
what was it she said to me?

21:23.609 --> 21:25.836
"Trapper,
you are not a serious person."

21:25.989 --> 21:27.104
Oh, she sounds very smart.

21:27.219 --> 21:30.099
Yeah, ish. She got a PhD.

21:30.214 --> 21:32.211
- Two, actually.
- [chuckles]

21:33.824 --> 21:35.397
How's the kid doing?

21:35.512 --> 21:38.162
[Ilene] You know. Struggling.

21:38.315 --> 21:40.543
Trying to find her place
in the world.

21:40.620 --> 21:42.961
Yeah, I know how that goes.

21:43.115 --> 21:45.343
Don't worry,
she'll be all right.

21:45.420 --> 21:46.572
She got a good mum.

21:48.952 --> 21:50.065

22:01.893 --> 22:06.846
Doctor Andrews. Your guest
has been asking for you.

22:08.459 --> 22:09.534
[Bernie] Please don't take this
the wrong way,

22:09.688 --> 22:11.108
but can I just say,

22:11.185 --> 22:12.912
that your research library
has many glaring omissions.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.449
I had to call in
some serious favors

22:14.526 --> 22:15.792
from my Discord chat.
They were not...

22:15.946 --> 22:17.137
Bernie, do you have something?

22:17.252 --> 22:18.480
Yes, I've got something.
I do have something.

22:18.595 --> 22:20.094
Whatever signal
you guys are picking up,

22:20.248 --> 22:22.320
okay, we have seen similar
patterns repeating over time.

22:22.474 --> 22:24.855
And each spike corresponds
with a specific Titan event.

22:24.932 --> 22:26.660
Can you hold this, please?
Thank you so much.

22:26.737 --> 22:28.234
Okay, check this out.

22:28.310 --> 22:31.460
See this? King Ghidorah, huh?
First encounter with Godzilla.

22:31.575 --> 22:32.458
- Mm-hmm.
- Here, uh,

22:32.574 --> 22:33.955
discovery of Skull Island.

22:34.070 --> 22:35.721
All right. So what you're
saying is that these signals

22:35.837 --> 22:37.641
- aren't just random patterns.
- Yeah, it seems that way, yes.

22:37.756 --> 22:38.985
And Godzilla's
picking up on it?

22:39.063 --> 22:40.713
Oh, I can do you one better.
Now, look,

22:40.790 --> 22:42.020
I've looked
at points of similarities

22:42.173 --> 22:43.593
in each wave form
and I compared them

22:43.670 --> 22:44.900
- to that pattern, and...
- Bernie, what are you saying?

22:44.976 --> 22:46.167
It's a distress call!

22:46.319 --> 22:48.701
It's a distress call.
A psychic energy SOS.

22:48.778 --> 22:51.043
Now, if your daughter is
seeing these symbols,

22:51.158 --> 22:53.808
then something down
there is calling for help.

22:53.885 --> 22:55.266
[suspenseful music playing]

22:56.688 --> 22:58.069
[Ilene]<i> Regular soundwaves,</i>

22:58.185 --> 23:00.259

without decay. This?

23:00.413 --> 23:02.217
This is something that
we have never encountered.

23:04.789 --> 23:06.019
Yeah,

23:06.173 --> 23:08.208
It's some sort of
distress signal.

23:09.283 --> 23:10.780
Signal? From what?

23:10.896 --> 23:11.779
Or from who.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.007
Well, whatever it is,

23:13.084 --> 23:14.466
this is why Godzilla's
on the move?

23:14.542 --> 23:16.232
We can't say for sure.
But it seems that way.

23:16.386 --> 23:18.767
[Hampton] Well, we have
to figure this out fast.

23:18.844 --> 23:21.992
The wolves are already
at our door.

23:22.145 --> 23:23.529
The government has been
looking for an excuse

23:23.644 --> 23:25.218
to take over
Hollow Earth operations.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.407
And the corporations
are licking their chops.

23:27.484 --> 23:29.020
Yeah,
because who wants to be rich

23:29.097 --> 23:30.670
and get rid
of all the monsters?

23:30.785 --> 23:32.322
I mean, that'd be terrible,
right?

23:32.436 --> 23:34.818
We'd better find the source
before D.C. gets wind of this.

23:35.701 --> 23:38.350
[sighs] Okay.

23:38.503 --> 23:40.655
I'm giving you
full operational oversight.

23:40.770 --> 23:42.958
Take a small team.
Mikael, make it fast

23:43.111 --> 23:44.341
and don't let anyone die.

23:44.456 --> 23:46.453
We'll be in and out of there
before nightfall.

Bernie, this isn't sightseeing.

24:57.375 --> 24:58.489
It's a reconnaissance mission.

24:58.642 --> 25:00.907

you toss me aside.

25:08.933 --> 25:11.236
Okay, look.
This could be dangerous.

25:11.351 --> 25:12.580
[scoffs] Come on.

I'm no stranger to danger.

I didn't mean to rhyme

25:18.725 --> 25:21.605
Look, you owe me. Okay?
I helped crack this thing.

[flapping lips]

36:29.320 --> 36:30.588
[snarls]

36:37.346 --> 36:38.766
[mini-Kong growling]

36:40.686 --> 36:42.108

36:43.298 --> 36:44.526
[screeches]

36:49.711 --> 36:51.092

36:52.629 --> 36:54.434

37:11.022 --> 37:12.442
[dramatic music playing]

37:17.971 --> 37:19.623
[tablet trilling]

37:20.198 --> 37:21.313
[Ilene sighs]

37:21.428 --> 37:22.848
Are you getting
anything off that thing?

37:22.963 --> 37:24.038
Yeah, I'm just...

37:26.688 --> 37:27.840
Oh, my God.

37:27.955 --> 37:28.992
What?

37:30.106 --> 37:31.911
Here. Take a look.

37:32.064 --> 37:34.791
It looks like an ape.
But that's impossible.

37:34.944 --> 37:37.095
What the bloody hell is that?

37:37.209 --> 37:38.476
I have no idea.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.050
[signal glitching]

37:40.166 --> 37:42.354
- Whoa! No! [screams]
- [Ilene] Whoa.

37:42.470 --> 37:44.236
[Trapper] Mikael! Mikael!

37:44.390 --> 37:45.466
I'm working on it!

37:45.542 --> 37:46.618
Come on, you...

37:46.770 --> 37:47.845
[Bernie] God!
Okay, okay, okay!

37:47.961 --> 37:49.305
[engine thrusters roaring]

37:51.647 --> 37:52.953
The hell was that, Mikael?

37:53.069 --> 37:54.374
Calm down. Calm down.

37:54.488 --> 37:55.755
It must've been the signal.
The same electrical

37:55.872 --> 37:57.254
disturbances were
happening at the outpost.

37:57.368 --> 37:58.328
[in sign language]

37:58.443 --> 38:00.594
[Bernie] Oh, come on. Come on.

38:02.975 --> 38:04.742
[sighs heavily]

38:04.857 --> 38:06.585
She says it's coming
from that ridge point.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.305
Well, let's take a look.

38:13.381 --> 38:14.993
[Mikael]
I'll get as close as I can.

38:17.528 --> 38:19.601
[door whirring and hissing]

38:20.293 --> 38:21.868
[birds calling]

38:23.788 --> 38:26.167
[mysterious music playing]

38:28.818 --> 38:30.161
[gasps in disbelief]

38:30.276 --> 38:32.081
The Hollow Earth.

38:32.196 --> 38:33.349
[gasps]

38:33.502 --> 38:36.689
A world untouched by mankind.

38:36.842 --> 38:39.262
Is this
how Neil Armstrong felt

38:39.377 --> 38:41.796
when he stepped on alien soil?

38:43.370 --> 38:45.944
[over video]
<i>Is this one small step for me,</i>

38:46.020 --> 38:47.096
<i>and one giant leap for...</i>

38:47.248 --> 38:48.400
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

38:48.515 --> 38:49.668
Are you kidding me?

38:49.783 --> 38:51.511
Right down the lens?
It's a documentary.

38:51.627 --> 38:53.123
You wanna be natural.
Just walk, if you just walk.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.235
<i>- All right, just keep...
- Yeah, just... Okay. Take two.</i>

38:55.390 --> 38:57.040
[Bernie clears throat]

38:57.155 --> 39:01.341
The Hollow Earth. A world...

39:01.418 --> 39:03.453
[Mikael] All right, guys.
That ridge you pointed out

39:03.568 --> 39:05.564
is about two miles
straight ahead.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.596
[mosquitos buzzing]

39:09.711 --> 39:11.209
I'm getting eaten alive
out here.

39:11.324 --> 39:12.784
[mosquito buzzing]

39:12.900 --> 39:16.509
Oh, look at that.
I must be tasty too.

39:17.199 --> 39:18.198
Kill it.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.922
Only female mosquitos
drink blood.

39:22.037 --> 39:23.498
So they can grow their eggs.

39:23.613 --> 39:25.571
[mosquito buzzing]

39:25.685 --> 39:27.261
She needs it more than me.

39:29.027 --> 39:30.524
[captivating music playing]

39:41.891 --> 39:43.772
[Trapper] Wait.

39:43.886 --> 39:46.537
- [Ilene] What?
- What's the holdup?

39:46.652 --> 39:48.033
Not this way.

39:48.150 --> 39:49.532
What? Why?

39:49.685 --> 39:51.183
Yeah, we gotta take a detour.
There's something here.

39:51.298 --> 39:53.410
Where, here? Like here, here?

39:53.524 --> 39:55.444
[Ilene] Hey.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.173
Nah. I'm not picking
anything up.

39:57.326 --> 39:58.593
No. Something
doesn't smell right,

39:58.670 --> 40:00.092
and it's not just you, Mikael.

40:00.206 --> 40:03.086
Can you smell that?
It's like rotting flesh.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.198
It's probably
just a carcass upwind.

40:05.313 --> 40:06.466
- We keep moving.
- Mikael, hold up.

40:06.581 --> 40:08.193
Listen, pal. I'm gonna trust

40:08.270 --> 40:10.113
my state of the art thermal
over your

40:10.189 --> 40:12.685
Ace Ventura
hippie-dippie sixth sense

40:12.762 --> 40:14.644
all day long. You got me?

40:14.759 --> 40:15.989
There's no need to call
people names. We're just...

40:16.104 --> 40:17.485
Hey. And as for you,
freak show,

40:17.600 --> 40:19.559
if you don't shut it,
I'm gonna take that camera,

40:19.674 --> 40:20.827
I'm gonna shove it
right up your arse.

40:20.981 --> 40:22.209
I'm in charge, we move.

40:22.324 --> 40:23.707
Why don't we just listen
to somebody calmer?

40:23.822 --> 40:24.897
I said I'm in charge.

40:25.012 --> 40:26.394
I'm in charge! [yells]

40:26.509 --> 40:27.892
- [Bernie] Whoa!
- [all gasp]

40:27.969 --> 40:29.582
- Run!
- [screams]

40:30.118 --> 40:31.270
[tree crunching]

40:31.425 --> 40:32.960
- [Bernie whimpering]
- [tree belches]

40:34.305 --> 40:35.649
[Bernie] It was a tree.
It was a tree!

40:35.763 --> 40:37.108
[Trapper] Wait, wait, wait.

40:37.223 --> 40:38.414
We should be all right.
We should be all right.

40:38.490 --> 40:39.795
Those things
don't reach that far.

40:39.910 --> 40:41.178
He was just eaten by a tree.

40:41.332 --> 40:42.752
- [Trapper] What you doing, Doc?
- [radio beeps]

40:42.868 --> 40:44.326
[Ilene] I'm trying to call
the Base for extraction.

40:44.441 --> 40:45.670
[Bernie] It's just, one minute
he was there, right?

40:45.786 --> 40:46.900
He was right in my face.
And then, a tree!

40:47.015 --> 40:47.821
- Outta nowhere!
- I know, man.

40:47.936 --> 40:49.012
I know. That's heavy.

40:49.126 --> 40:49.972
But that's
the natural world, man.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.046
"Red in tooth and claw."

40:51.161 --> 40:53.658
Tennyson.
You just watched a man

40:53.773 --> 40:55.154
get devoured
by a topiary nightmare,

40:55.270 --> 40:57.344
and you want to quote
Tennyson? Down here?

40:57.498 --> 41:00.224
Yeah. Yeah, man.
He knew all about it.

41:00.378 --> 41:02.451
"Let love clasp grief," man.
Come here.

41:02.528 --> 41:03.679
[Bernie] Mm.

41:03.794 --> 41:04.793
You know, humans,
we think we took

41:04.908 --> 41:06.905
ourselves off the food chain,

41:07.021 --> 41:11.551
but maybe, maybe the Titans
are here to remind us.

41:12.819 --> 41:13.779
I think that
there is something

41:13.894 --> 41:15.391
seriously wrong with you.

41:16.389 --> 41:17.387
- Okay.
- Mm-kay.

41:17.503 --> 41:19.077
- Okay.
- Mm.

41:19.154 --> 41:21.035
- [radio beeps]
- [sighs] It's not working.

41:21.189 --> 41:23.954
We better move on.
We'll mourn later.

41:25.452 --> 41:26.718
Jia. Come on.

41:26.833 --> 41:28.025
- Come on, bud.
- But the...

41:28.178 --> 41:30.137
He was eaten by a tree.

41:30.213 --> 41:32.133
I don't...
I don't want to die like that.

41:32.249 --> 41:33.400
Not by a tree.

41:37.816 --> 41:39.351
[crowd screaming]

41:39.467 --> 41:40.773
[Godzilla growling]

[Ilene] Hey.

43:02.753 --> 43:04.520
[in sign language]

43:04.597 --> 43:06.440
Yeah.

43:06.593 --> 43:08.207
The markings are older
than the ones

43:08.321 --> 43:10.089

Centuries older.

43:12.315 --> 43:13.505

Hello.

[Bernie and Trapper]
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

45:11.466 --> 45:15.729
[Bernie] It's like some kind of
a irrigation system. [laughs]

Only this predates everything

the Lemurians...

I mean, these guys
were the first, man!

- Jia.
- [Bernie] It just keeps going.

Yeah.

this SOS, and then what?

Godzilla hears it?

Yeah. They woke him up.

An SOS for what?
They already live

57:37.593 --> 57:38.745
in a nightmare
monster hellscape.

57:38.860 --> 57:40.165
What could possibly
scare them?

57:40.280 --> 57:42.008
Hey. She can understand
everything that you say.

57:42.123 --> 57:44.467
- She understands me?
- Oh, good.

57:44.620 --> 57:46.078
And a nightmare

[Ilene] This whole room
is covered in Iwi script.

58:53.929 --> 58:56.387
It says that in the beginning,

58:56.503 --> 59:00.189
Hollow Earth lived in harmony
with the surface world.

59:00.304 --> 59:03.376
The Titans were
the guardians of nature

59:03.453 --> 59:07.178
and the Great Apes became
the protectors of humanity.

But a great evil
threatened the peace.

Godzilla.

59:26.798 --> 59:28.105

59:28.220 --> 59:30.831
The war with the Apes
nearly destroyed Godzilla.

59:30.946 --> 59:32.481
But after a great battle,

59:32.558 --> 59:33.865
he imprisoned the apes

59:33.980 --> 59:36.015
in a fiery realm
of Hollow Earth.

59:36.092 --> 59:38.395
Their false king
remains obsessed

59:38.472 --> 59:40.046

[Ilene] He controls her

Her power covered the Earth

01:07:28.703 --> 01:07:30.392
We brought Kong down here.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.160
He's been looking
for others like himself,

01:07:32.312 --> 01:07:33.811
going deeper
into Hollow Earth

01:07:33.926 --> 01:07:35.807
and getting closer
to their prison.

01:07:35.923 --> 01:07:38.149
The Iwi must have known
it was just a matter of time,

01:07:38.264 --> 01:07:39.686
and that's why they've been

01:07:39.801 --> 01:07:42.987
calling for help, and that's
why Godzilla's changing.

01:07:43.102 --> 01:07:44.447
He's gearing up
for World War Three.

01:07:44.562 --> 01:07:46.405
Okay, but he barely survived
last time.

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:48.249
What's Godzilla
gonna do on his own?

01:07:50.092 --> 01:07:52.625
He won't be on his own.

01:07:52.779 --> 01:07:55.543
The Iwi believe
that at the end of the world,

01:07:55.659 --> 01:07:58.040
one of their own
will return...

01:07:58.155 --> 01:08:01.303
and awaken Mothra,
defender of the Iwi...

01:08:01.418 --> 01:08:03.839
and ancient ally of Godzilla.

01:08:03.991 --> 01:08:06.065
They believe
that their savior will be

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.985
an Iwi from Skull Island.

01:08:10.749 --> 01:08:13.015
That seems like a lot
to put on one kid.

[Ilene] You know, I made
a deal with myself

01:10:48.032 --> 01:10:49.760
when I became a mother.

01:10:49.836 --> 01:10:53.253
I said to myself, "I don't care
what you have to sacrifice...

01:10:56.364 --> 01:10:58.514

I just never thought that

01:11:02.969 --> 01:11:05.502
the thing I'd be giving up
would be her.

01:11:05.617 --> 01:11:07.154
Look, you don't know that.

01:11:07.269 --> 01:11:08.153
Really?

01:11:08.267 --> 01:11:09.572
Trapper, before we came here

01:11:09.688 --> 01:11:12.799
she said that
she didn't belong anywhere.

01:11:12.952 --> 01:11:15.755
If this is the life
that she wants,

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:17.560
then I have to give her up.

01:11:24.663 --> 01:11:27.314
[rumbling]

01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:28.772
[Trapper] Am I having
a funny turn

01:11:28.888 --> 01:11:30.078

[Trapper] What are they doing?
That must weigh a ton.

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:39.640
[Bernie] Yeah. Yeah, see,

01:11:39.716 --> 01:11:41.251
I don't know
how they can do it...

01:11:41.406 --> 01:11:43.210
but somehow they're able to
move the pyramids' positions,

01:11:43.326 --> 01:11:44.324
which disrupts the

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.090
gravitational pull
down here,

01:11:46.206 --> 01:11:48.202

they run their city.

01:12:09.207 --> 01:12:12.623
This place is special, man.
It's magic.

01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:14.083

it'll stay like that

01:12:14.237 --> 01:12:16.425

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:20.073

You know I think
you're brilliant, don't you?

01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:29.864
You already saved

Can't take that away from you.

01:12:33.475 --> 01:12:34.856

down here...

It's why Jia was called here.
