You know what happened.

01:10.226 --> 01:12.069
Yeah, well,
I wanna hear it from you.

01:15.255 --> 01:17.022
I was buying pot

01:23.780 --> 01:25.815
No. No, you're not.

01:25.893 --> 01:27.582
I think Tommy was buying
the drugs, not you.

01:27.735 --> 01:28.811
I think you happened
to walk by,

01:28.927 --> 01:29.887

who got called to the scene.

01:35.377 --> 01:36.607
I'm not stupid.

weren't my sons,

It was humiliating.

If you know what it feels like,
then why?

02:59.127 --> 03:01.661
That's not why
I'm telling you this.

15:16.975 --> 15:18.704
Okay, how much longer, man?

15:18.819 --> 15:20.432
[sighs]
We're here.

15:31.261 --> 15:32.297
Oh, my God.

15:32.412 --> 15:34.485

-Like it?

-Ellie!

15:51.996 --> 15:54.415
Oh, my God.
Careful.

15:55.875 --> 15:59.715
I'm on a motherfucking
dinosaur! [chuckles]

16:01.519 --> 16:03.055
-Joel, there's a museum!
-Yeah, I know!

16:03.170 --> 16:05.128
If you don't fall off
the goddamn T-Rex,

16:05.243 --> 16:06.435
I'll take you there.

16:15.113 --> 16:17.877
[Ellie] [whispering]
This is so cool.

16:19.068 --> 16:21.640
How long have you known
about this place?

16:21.717 --> 16:22.908
A while.

16:22.985 --> 16:25.249
Well, then what the fuck?

16:25.365 --> 16:27.438
I was saving it
for a special day.

16:27.516 --> 16:30.318
You see?
Patience.

16:30.396 --> 16:32.316
Oh, yeah,
I've heard of that.

16:33.928 --> 16:34.926
Huh.

17:06.606 --> 17:07.719

17:07.836 --> 17:09.639
Somebody must have
greased it.

17:17.781 --> 17:19.892
[Ellie] Can you imagine
being up there?

17:22.274 --> 17:24.463
-Would you like to?
-Like to what?

17:25.346 --> 17:26.421
Go to space?

Is it real?

17:45.082 --> 17:47.770
It's real.
That one went up and back.

-[Ellie sighs]

18:21.716 --> 18:22.868
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:22.984 --> 18:24.827
You're going up to space.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.247
You need a helmet.

18:29.357 --> 18:30.817

How's it smell in there?

19:16.782 --> 19:19.393
Like space, and dust.

19:19.469 --> 19:21.773
Well, good.

20:02.938 --> 20:05.703
-Happy birthday, kiddo.
-What's this?

20:05.818 --> 20:10.349
This is something that took

[stammering] with girls?

24:27.703 --> 24:31.005
It wasn't sex, and it
wasn't a fucking experiment.

No, it isn't.
You don't own it.

25:48.879 --> 25:51.913
They gave it to you.
Sorry, to us.

You don't own anything.

Look, I'm s-sorry
that I got a tattoo,

26:06.351 --> 26:09.347
and smoked weed,
and fooled around with a girl.

26:11.267 --> 26:12.611
Except, I'm not.

26:15.491 --> 26:16.604
Maybe, um...

26:20.597 --> 26:22.940
Maybe it's a good thing
for you to have
your own space.

26:25.282 --> 26:26.588
Just give me a few days

26:26.704 --> 26:28.624
and let me fix things up
a little out there.

26:30.697 --> 26:31.696
Okay.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.380
Come on.

26:52.123 --> 26:53.622
[sighs] Thanks.

26:53.737 --> 26:54.697
Sure.

26:57.922 --> 26:59.073
Can I see?

27:05.065 --> 27:07.138
-Did it hurt?
-Yeah.

27:09.518 --> 27:10.940
But kinda good.

27:14.357 --> 27:15.701
It's actually not bad.

27:16.968 --> 27:21.346
Better than the,
uh, one I made
on your guitar anyway.

27:26.990 --> 27:28.988
I never did ask.
What is it with the moths?

27:30.985 --> 27:32.905
Um, nothing. Just--

27:33.020 --> 27:36.360
I just read about them
in a book on dreams and stuff.

27:36.513 --> 27:38.050
It's kind of symbolic.

27:38.164 --> 27:39.624
Oh, right.

27:41.429 --> 27:46.306
Yeah, like change and--
and growin' and such.

27:49.991 --> 27:51.221
It's late.

27:51.950 --> 27:52.949
Yeah.

27:54.484 --> 27:55.598
Well, good night.

28:16.066 --> 28:17.141
[Joel] Hey.

28:19.597 --> 28:23.284
You guys study, uh,
dreams and stuff, right?

28:24.551 --> 28:26.549
Is there
a "Doctor Is In" sign
on me like Lucy

28:26.664 --> 28:28.584
from fuckin'<i> Peanuts?</i>

28:31.271 --> 28:34.574
Yes, some doctors
studied dreams.

28:34.689 --> 28:36.533
The dumb ones, mostly.

28:36.685 --> 28:38.605
So, a moth.

28:38.682 --> 28:41.639
That probably means
change and-- and growth?

28:42.369 --> 28:44.097
No, that would be
a butterfly.

28:44.981 --> 28:47.131
Oh.
So, what's a moth?

28:47.245 --> 28:48.320
Death.

28:49.511 --> 28:51.085
If you believe in that shit.

29:00.571 --> 29:01.531

29:29.985 --> 29:31.982
[poster rustling]

30:02.086 --> 30:04.506
Okay,
so I've been thinking...

30:05.428 --> 30:07.809
or wondering--
no, thinking,

30:07.923 --> 30:09.881
uh, for a while now...

30:10.803 --> 30:12.915
about Salt Lake City.

30:14.490 --> 30:16.333
I just want
to understand it.

30:18.138 --> 30:20.903
So, I wrote down
some questions.

30:22.132 --> 30:23.092
Okay?

30:25.395 --> 30:26.355
Okay.

30:34.879 --> 30:37.261
One, if the Fireflies

30:37.376 --> 30:39.564
spotted us a mile
from the hospital,

30:39.718 --> 30:42.906
how did they get surprised
by an entire group of Raiders?

30:46.630 --> 30:47.975
Two.

30:48.090 --> 30:51.046
If the Raiders could
kill all those soldiers,

30:51.161 --> 30:54.962
and Marlene, and you had
to carry me the whole time,

30:55.078 --> 30:56.499
how did we get away?

30:57.804 --> 31:00.069
Three, if there are dozens
of immune people,

31:00.224 --> 31:02.221
-why hasn't anyone heard--
-[knocking]

31:03.104 --> 31:04.294

31:04.410 --> 31:05.408

31:06.906 --> 31:08.173
Uh, coming.

31:12.396 --> 31:14.547
-[clearing throat]
-Whoa.

31:15.276 --> 31:16.813
Already dressed.

31:16.965 --> 31:18.694
I figured
I'd be waking you up.

31:18.809 --> 31:21.151
Uh, nope.
I had trouble sleeping.

31:21.228 --> 31:22.149
Huh.

31:22.304 --> 31:23.571
Well, guess what?
That works out great

31:23.724 --> 31:25.261
for your birthday present.

31:25.376 --> 31:27.756
You're 19
and you've been patient.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.520
So, I told 'em
I was okay with it.

31:30.636 --> 31:33.592
-With what?
-Your first patrol.

31:35.705 --> 31:37.625
-I'll grab my coat.
-And a gun.

31:46.149 --> 31:48.147
[horse chortling]

31:49.491 --> 31:51.142
[Ellie]
So, what's the record
for number of kills

31:51.257 --> 31:52.754
on a training run?

31:52.869 --> 31:55.749
Zero. This is
the safest trail we got.

31:55.903 --> 31:56.863
Gotta start easy.

31:56.979 --> 31:58.783
Ah, great.
Happy birthday to me.

31:59.974 --> 32:02.623
-Come on, binoculars.
-Why? There's nothing out here.

32:02.777 --> 32:05.195
I know, but this is about
learnin' the ropes.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.807
So, pretend, okay?

32:09.880 --> 32:12.262
It's part of the rules.
You stick with your partner,

32:12.339 --> 32:14.987
scan the countryside,
be ready for anything.

32:15.564 --> 32:16.907
-Oh, shit.
-What?

32:18.406 --> 32:21.823
There's a little squirrel
fucking a big squirrel!

32:21.938 --> 32:23.320
We should probably
report that.

32:25.509 --> 32:27.275
Fine, we'll skip
the scannin' for now.

32:31.654 --> 32:33.382
But this is nice, right?

32:33.497 --> 32:36.300
Reminds me of the old days,
just you and me on the trail.

32:37.375 --> 32:39.180
I know you got stuff going on,
but it'd be nice

32:39.295 --> 32:41.752
if we could do
this kind of thing more often.

32:41.905 --> 32:43.135
Spend time together.

32:46.284 --> 32:47.244
Yeah.

32:51.698 --> 32:53.425
-You okay?
-Yeah.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.000
-It's just, you look...
-No, I--

32:55.115 --> 32:56.728

-No, nothing.

Go back.

We go back to the gate.

-You don't understand.
-I do.

But we have rules,

Huh?

37:06.824 --> 37:08.016
Hold out your hand.

Now, count slowly,

No.

you can't do this to me.

39:39.003 --> 39:39.924
Joel.

If you have last words for her,
I'll pass them along.

[Eugene]
Last words for her?

39:46.144 --> 39:49.677
No, no, I need--
I need her last words!

For me!

I, uh...

I need Gail.

Please.

40:15.482 --> 40:17.747
Please let that be
the last thing I see.

I'm sorry.

42:20.089 --> 42:22.392
I'm gonna radio ahead
and let them know.

42:24.274 --> 42:28.576
When we get there,
I'll-- I'll tell Gail

42:28.691 --> 42:31.109
what she needs to know,
and nothin' more.

It's the right thing to do.

when we found him.

43:28.479 --> 43:29.630
And, uh...

43:31.205 --> 43:33.393
Well, he wanted to tell you
that he loved you.

43:36.735 --> 43:40.075
And, uh, he wished
he could say goodbye
to you in person

43:40.190 --> 43:42.110
but he didn't wanna
put you in danger.

43:42.225 --> 43:43.532
[crying] No, no.

43:44.145 --> 43:46.680
[Joel]
And he wasn't scared. He...

43:47.602 --> 43:49.022
He was brave.

43:52.017 --> 43:53.591
And he ended it himself.

He had time.

to take him to you.

44:19.282 --> 44:20.817
He promised us both.

Joel shot him in the head.

turn away from me.

you can't understand.

54:11.902 --> 54:13.208
Maybe you never will.

54:16.434 --> 54:18.239
But if that day should come...

54:20.772 --> 54:22.885
if you should ever
have one of your own...

54:29.143 --> 54:30.219
well, then...

54:34.212 --> 54:36.094
I hope you do
a little better than me.

54:37.092 --> 54:38.245
[Ellie sniffling]

54:42.698 --> 54:44.965
[sighs deeply]

54:52.837 --> 54:55.293
I don't think I can
forgive you for this.

55:04.510 --> 55:06.238
But I would like to try.

55:09.501 --> 55:12.496
[â™ª gentle music playing]

55:18.410 --> 55:20.446
[rain falling]

55:22.903 --> 55:24.976
[thunder rumbling]

55:34.499 --> 55:36.266
[thunder crashing]

55:36.419 --> 55:39.415
[â™ª soft music playing]

55:45.059 --> 55:47.479
[â™ª music swells]

55:50.973 --> 55:54.007
[â™ª gentle music playing]

56:57.440 --> 56:59.360
[â™ª music fades out]
