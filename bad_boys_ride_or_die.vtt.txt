10:26.747 --> 10:28.127
(song ends)

10:28.320 --> 10:29.855
(horns honking)

10:30.045 --> 10:32.003
Hey, buddy.

10:32.194 --> 10:33.728
What you doing?

10:33.921 --> 10:37.565
I spent my whole life
being scared, Mike.

10:37.757 --> 10:39.791
I wasted so much time.

10:39.982 --> 10:41.824
Wh-Why don't you, uh...
why don't you just, uh,

10:42.015 --> 10:44.163
step back from the edge
a little bit, please.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.504
What year is it?

10:46.695 --> 10:48.422
It's Tuesday.

10:49.457 --> 10:51.491
Same year your ass
was wobbling in.

10:51.683 --> 10:54.368
Oh, wow.
Felt like it was five years.

10:54.561 --> 10:57.360
I was in the basement
of the ocean.

10:57.553 --> 10:59.586
All my bullshit was gone.

10:59.777 --> 11:01.695
Just freedom.

11:01.888 --> 11:03.653
And full-body love, Mike.

11:03.844 --> 11:05.571
-Full-body love.
-All right. Okay.

11:05.762 --> 11:07.604
Wh-Why-Why don't you, uh,

11:07.795 --> 11:10.902
love your full body back
from the-the ledge, please?

11:11.095 --> 11:12.285
MARCUS:
Nothing to be scared of.

11:12.475 --> 11:13.972
It's not my time, baby.

11:14.163 --> 11:15.238
It's not my time.

11:15.430 --> 11:16.620
-(door opens)
-NURSE: Mr. Burnett!

11:16.810 --> 11:18.998
MIKE:
Uh, uh, hey, uh, I got him.

11:19.189 --> 11:21.222
He-he-he's just, um...

11:21.415 --> 11:23.218
(sighs)

11:23.409 --> 11:25.251
I don't know
what the fuck he's doing.

11:25.442 --> 11:27.170
Uh, but I got it.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.854
I-I got him.
We're good. We are good.

11:30.047 --> 11:32.041
-We are great!
-Hey.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.844
-MARCUS: Miami!
-MIKE: Whoa.

-All right, just... (stammers)
-Kakow!

11:38.601 --> 11:39.983
You gonna put somebody's
eye out with that thing, man.

11:40.174 --> 11:41.556
I'm bringing the thunder, Mike.

11:41.747 --> 11:43.129
-I get it.
-Bringing the thunder.

11:43.321 --> 11:45.776
-Yeah, all right. There you go.
-(Marcus hollers, laughs)

11:45.968 --> 11:47.118
Oh, man.

11:47.310 --> 11:48.500
Bring it in.

11:48.690 --> 11:50.072
Thought I lost you, brother.

11:50.263 --> 11:52.642
Couldn't lose me if you tried.

11:55.289 --> 11:57.246
You know your ass is out,
right?

11:57.437 --> 11:59.471
Everybody's ass is out, Mike.

11:59.663 --> 12:01.159
Hey.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.767
There's a storm coming.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.225
(wind whistling)

12:05.418 --> 12:08.065
No, not that kind of storm.

12:08.257 --> 12:10.021
You're gonna be tested.

12:10.213 --> 12:11.824
Things are gonna get bad,

12:12.016 --> 12:14.317
and you're gonna have to make
a really hard choice.

12:14.510 --> 12:17.962
Just know you're good.

12:42.246 --> 12:44.548
This is my private time,
Mr. McGrath.

12:44.740 --> 12:45.930
How may I help you?

12:46.120 --> 12:47.848
I need you to move some money.

12:48.039 --> 12:49.842
-Your money?
-Your boss's, actually.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.454
I need it to be cartel cash.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.219
Just under 20 million.

Backdated series of transfers--

12:55.022 --> 12:57.860
beginning 2004,
ending January 2020--

12:58.052 --> 13:01.428
into that account

13:01.620 --> 13:04.343
in the name of the late
Captain Conrad Howard.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.260
I have people
who can handle logistics.

13:07.451 --> 13:09.867
I really just need
your log-in credentials.

13:10.059 --> 13:12.170
And why would I give you those?

13:13.129 --> 13:15.278
Oh, my God! (whimpers)

13:15.469 --> 13:16.926
Shh.

13:17.119 --> 13:18.729
(quiet whimpering)

13:20.188 --> 13:21.761
McGRATH:
Come here, darling.

13:22.759 --> 13:24.599
-Come on.
-(whimpering)

13:25.713 --> 13:27.170
Come here.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.112
You can't transfer funds
from a phone.

13:41.019 --> 13:41.902
Hey, honey. What's going on?

13:42.093 --> 13:44.740
Do... do...
do they know each other?

13:44.933 --> 13:46.352
(whimpering)

13:46.543 --> 13:47.925
Honey, who's there with you?

13:48.116 --> 13:49.613
-All right, all right.
-Honey...

13:58.091 --> 14:00.009
-(typing)
-Here we go.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.341
They'll kill you for this.

14:05.534 --> 14:07.222
They're not even gonna know
this happened.

14:09.102 --> 14:12.746
Your girlfriend heard you
on the phone with your wife

14:12.938 --> 14:15.508
and realized you were never
gonna divorce her.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.232
And in a fit of passion,
she shot you.

14:18.423 --> 14:19.497
(girlfriend whimpers)

14:19.690 --> 14:21.570
Your bodyguard tried
to step in,

14:21.761 --> 14:22.835
but he was too late.

14:23.832 --> 14:24.831
(quiet whimpering)

14:25.021 --> 14:27.784
And realizing the horror
of her actions...

14:30.355 --> 14:32.005
-...she took her own life.
-No!

THERESA (over phone):
Honey, what are you doing?

14:44.166 --> 14:46.236
-You had a heart attack
two weeks ago. -Exactly.

14:46.429 --> 14:47.964
They call it a widow-maker
for a reason.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.342
You need to be
in the hospital, baby.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.605
Hey, I tried to...
Told his ass, T.

14:52.798 --> 14:54.716
He... Yeah, uh,
apparently, he's an adult.

14:54.907 --> 14:56.403
He was allowed
to sign hisself out.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.359
(groans) Hey, babe, look.

14:58.552 --> 15:00.968
Come on. I couldn't take
one more second away from you.

15:01.161 --> 15:04.268
All these stents in me
got my blood flowing.

15:04.459 --> 15:06.147
I'm on "D" way.

15:08.220 --> 15:09.254

15:10.942 --> 15:13.168

All right. Love you.

Hey, Mike, I wasn't even
gonna tell you this,

15:20.035 --> 15:21.762
but this ain't
the first time we done this.

15:21.953 --> 15:23.986
We ride together all the time.
What you mean?

15:24.179 --> 15:25.752
No, I'm talking about
our souls.

15:25.943 --> 15:27.440
You know,
we've ridden together,

15:27.632 --> 15:29.089
but I saw it all, Mike.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.312
We're bound, and we have been
for lifetimes.

15:32.503 --> 15:34.536
We haven't always been
Mike and Marcus,

15:34.729 --> 15:36.417
but we've always been us.

15:36.608 --> 15:37.875
Um...

15:39.294 --> 15:40.329
What you talking about?

15:40.521 --> 15:42.171
(whispers):
We're soulmates.

-Yeah.

Nah.

Yeah, I kind of...
I-I saw my soulmate looking

15:49.614 --> 15:51.378
a little different than that.

15:51.569 --> 15:53.603
See, see, see, Mike,
you stuck in the physical.

15:53.795 --> 15:55.483
Souls don't have dicks.

15:55.674 --> 15:57.517
I'm pretty sure my soul
has a dick, Marcus.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.394
See?
That's that shit right there.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.736
That's why we're stuck.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.460
You know, I wasn't gonna
tell you this shit, either...

16:04.651 --> 16:06.379
-Mm-hmm.
-...but, uh, my soul is

16:06.569 --> 16:08.028
more advanced than your soul.

16:08.219 --> 16:09.677
Mm. Mm-hmm.

16:09.870 --> 16:12.478
It's not that your soul
is stupid.

16:12.669 --> 16:13.553
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

16:13.743 --> 16:15.739
It's just that
you're more like a...

16:15.930 --> 16:18.348
-a baby soul, you know?
-Mm-hmm.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.535
And I'm more like
a mother soul.

16:20.726 --> 16:22.490
-Mm-hmm.
-And I just got to suckle you.

Captain is down.

19:54.910 --> 19:56.291
He's my son.

19:56.482 --> 19:58.631
MARCUS (voice-over): You got
a fucked-up family, Mike.

20:00.587 --> 20:02.198
(distorted grunt)

20:08.413 --> 20:10.331
â™ª â™ª

20:15.126 --> 20:17.083
(cell phone vibrating)

20:21.072 --> 20:22.723
Department of Justice
has been investigating

20:22.915 --> 20:24.833
the corruption
in the Miami Police Department,

20:25.025 --> 20:27.250
and we now have
credible intelligence

20:27.442 --> 20:30.471 line:20%
that Captain Conrad Howard
was directing these elements

20:30.663 --> 20:32.620 line:20%
in coordination
with the cartels.

20:32.812 --> 20:34.538
(reporters clamoring on video)

20:35.843 --> 20:38.299
GRICE: No, I'm not interested
in approximately what time.

20:38.490 --> 20:39.948
I need to know
exactly what time.

20:40.140 --> 20:41.482
Do you understand?

20:42.479 --> 20:43.516
You knew about this?

20:43.708 --> 20:45.895
I found out two weeks ago.

20:46.085 --> 20:47.391
A press conference? Really?

20:47.583 --> 20:49.577
I'm sorry about the way
you had to find out,

20:49.769 --> 20:50.881
but given your closeness...

20:51.073 --> 20:52.186
Our closeness?

20:52.378 --> 20:53.758
Neither one of y'all
would have a job

20:53.950 --> 20:55.600
if it wasn't for
Captain Howard.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.442
Rita, you know
this is not true.

20:57.634 --> 21:00.012
Honestly, I don't.

21:00.203 --> 21:02.351
The investigation
has turned up new evidence.

21:02.543 --> 21:03.964
GRICE:
Miami law enforcement's been

21:04.156 --> 21:05.651
a leaky ship for years now.

21:05.844 --> 21:07.033
Witnesses turn up dead.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.644
Informants disappear.

21:08.835 --> 21:11.560
Events appear random
until you aggregate them

21:11.751 --> 21:13.592
over a period of years.

21:13.785 --> 21:15.434
Then a pattern emerges.

21:15.626 --> 21:16.968
Who is this?

21:17.160 --> 21:20.382
Bud Grice, FBI, heading up
the JTF on this show.

21:20.574 --> 21:21.649
That's who I am.

21:21.841 --> 21:24.832
Now, we knew someone was
providing intelligence

21:25.025 --> 21:27.249
to a cartel moving product
into South Florida.

21:27.442 --> 21:28.976
We just didn't know who.

21:29.168 --> 21:30.818
LOCKWOOD:
A cartel banker turned up dead

21:31.010 --> 21:32.812
two weeks ago,
shot by his girlfriend.

21:33.004 --> 21:35.229
They found a phone
with Howard's contact on it.

21:35.421 --> 21:37.070
Years of communication
with the cartel,

21:37.263 --> 21:39.412
account references offshore.

21:39.603 --> 21:41.175
Millions in Howard's name.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.400
Final piece we needed to nail
that dirty motherfucker.

21:43.592 --> 21:44.590
-LOCKWOOD: Grice.
-Oh, whoa.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.009
Hey, hey. Let me holla at you.

21:46.201 --> 21:49.577
Um, you know I was with him
when he went down, right?

21:50.574 --> 21:53.261
Call him dirty one more time.

21:53.452 --> 21:54.641
I dare you.

21:56.637 --> 21:58.363
We know he had others
who were with him.

21:58.555 --> 21:59.666
We're gonna find them, too.

21:59.858 --> 22:02.007
I was with him.
Put the cuffs on me right now.

22:02.199 --> 22:03.771
-I was with him.
-Mike.

22:03.963 --> 22:05.690
No, these motherfuckers think
that just 'cause he's dead

22:05.881 --> 22:07.263
and can't defend hisself,

22:07.455 --> 22:10.178
they gonna dump all this shit
on him, burn his legacy.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.096
Not on my watch.

22:16.317 --> 22:18.926
This is Judy Howard,
U.S. Marshals.

22:19.117 --> 22:21.151
I realize I have
no jurisdiction here,

22:21.343 --> 22:24.066
but as a professional courtesy,
I'd like to request visibility

22:24.258 --> 22:26.675
into the sources of the
allegations against my father.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.132
Judy.

22:28.325 --> 22:31.009
We're gonna figure
this shit out, all right?

22:31.202 --> 22:32.660
How's Callie?

22:33.887 --> 22:35.460
How do you think, Mike?

22:35.651 --> 22:38.108
We're on the same team here,
Judy.

22:38.298 --> 22:39.411
Like hell we are, Mike.

22:39.604 --> 22:41.598
My dad would still be alive
if it weren't for

22:41.790 --> 22:43.709
-your bastard son.
-Judy.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.550
If I ever catch him
out on the street,

22:45.741 --> 22:48.810
I swear on my father
I will put him down.

22:50.115 --> 22:52.033
MARCUS:
Come on. Come on, man. Come on.

22:56.177 --> 22:57.558
So, what's our next move?

22:57.750 --> 22:59.668
They said he was working
with the cartel.

22:59.859 --> 23:01.240
Let's ask the cartel.

23:12.020 --> 23:13.670
How you doing?

23:13.862 --> 23:15.204
It's prison.

23:15.396 --> 23:16.471
MIKE:
Yeah.

23:16.662 --> 23:19.655
Look, we need your help.

23:19.847 --> 23:21.573
They're saying that
Captain Howard was dirty.

23:21.765 --> 23:24.220
Do you know anything
about that?

23:24.412 --> 23:26.062
How much time I get off
for this one?

23:26.253 --> 23:27.672
MIKE:
I'm still working on that.

23:27.864 --> 23:31.126
This is me telling you
that I need you.

23:31.318 --> 23:32.353
Mm.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.694
I need to know
if Captain Howard

23:34.884 --> 23:37.033
was working with the cartels.

23:39.833 --> 23:41.676
No.

23:41.868 --> 23:44.284
He was onto the ones that were.

23:44.475 --> 23:46.049
So he got green-lit.

23:47.852 --> 23:50.077
Wait, no.
No, Captain Howard was killed

23:50.269 --> 23:51.996
because he was on
your mother's hit list.

23:52.187 --> 23:54.028
He was added to it.

23:55.065 --> 23:57.596
Your people wanted it
to look like us.

23:57.788 --> 23:59.782
Your people wanted him dead.

23:59.974 --> 24:02.008
What you mean "our people"?

24:02.199 --> 24:04.272
You should be careful.

24:04.464 --> 24:06.918
You're playing a game when
you don't even know the rules.

24:07.111 --> 24:09.029
There's dirty players
on your side.

24:09.221 --> 24:11.216
-That's bullshit.
-Wait, who?

24:12.250 --> 24:13.478
I saw him one time.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.269
-Can you I.D. him?
-SÃ­.

24:21.343 --> 24:22.494
Give me a name.

24:22.686 --> 24:23.837
I don't know his name.

24:24.028 --> 24:25.409
My mother.

24:25.602 --> 24:27.520
(voice-over): She's the one
who dealt with him.

24:27.712 --> 24:31.202
(scoffs) I knew we should've
kept that damn witch alive.

24:31.394 --> 24:32.469
Marcus.

24:32.660 --> 24:34.770
May she rest in peace.

24:34.963 --> 24:36.458
Dude.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.834
â™ª â™ª

24:40.026 --> 24:42.174
(quiet chatter)

24:43.518 --> 24:45.397
LINTZ: Hey, boss.
Our man on the inside

24:45.588 --> 24:47.928
got all of Howard's records
in the JTF file.

24:48.121 --> 24:50.308
Computers, phones,
files, all of it.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.033
Well, we know Howard
was onto our operation.

24:52.226 --> 24:53.646
We just don't know
how much he had.

24:53.837 --> 24:55.409
We need to make sure
we got every trace.

24:55.601 --> 24:57.289
That's beautiful.

24:57.482 --> 24:59.132
Hey, boss.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.280
It's all the paper files.
They're clean so far.

25:01.472 --> 25:02.699
NICOLE:
Two phones had nothing.

25:02.890 --> 25:04.119
His office computer was empty.

25:04.310 --> 25:05.615
-He was careful.
-But?

25:05.807 --> 25:07.110
NICOLE:
But his old personal laptop

25:07.303 --> 25:08.684
had weak encryption.

25:08.875 --> 25:12.213
-Here... we go.
-(computer trilling)

25:13.440 --> 25:14.783
Shit.

25:14.976 --> 25:16.664
We tripped a fail-safe.

25:16.855 --> 25:18.236
The fuck you mean, "we"?

25:18.427 --> 25:20.040
Something was sent.

25:20.231 --> 25:21.919
To who?

25:22.111 --> 25:24.374
NICOLE:
Tracing the phone now.

25:24.567 --> 25:26.446
(cell phones vibrate and chime)

25:30.896 --> 25:31.855
What the hell?

25:32.046 --> 25:33.927
He's texting us
from the other side.

25:34.119 --> 25:36.076
No, he's not, Marcus.

25:40.641 --> 25:44.821
If you're seeing this,
I'm probably dead.

25:45.013 --> 25:47.815
Fuck. Fuck me.

25:48.007 --> 25:51.995
Before I begin,
I want to say one thing:

25:52.187 --> 25:54.528
I'm putting you
in mortal danger.

25:54.720 --> 25:58.671
Boys, we got rats in our walls.

25:58.863 --> 26:03.313
But I-I got to make sure
you're my bad boys.

26:04.924 --> 26:07.379
The Coke bottle giant
is the key.

26:07.571 --> 26:09.106
What?

26:09.297 --> 26:12.022
Don't trust anybody.

26:14.209 --> 26:15.360
What's that?
What does that mean?

26:15.552 --> 26:18.467
"The Coke bottle giant."

26:19.656 --> 26:21.114
(snapping fingers)

26:21.306 --> 26:22.226
Fletcher.

26:22.418 --> 26:24.030
Oh, shit.

26:24.222 --> 26:25.602
NICOLE:
These are the guys.

26:28.632 --> 26:30.167
We should put a bullet
in these motherfuckers.

26:30.359 --> 26:31.510
Be done with it
once and for all.

26:31.703 --> 26:32.853
Lintz, I love you.

26:33.044 --> 26:34.656
I'd like nothing more
than to let you loose on them,

26:34.848 --> 26:37.264
but extra dead cops
doesn't do us any favors here.

26:38.608 --> 26:39.988
(voice-over): Keep them
under constant surveillance

26:40.180 --> 26:42.098
and see if they make a move.

26:45.666 --> 26:47.738
Fletcher's warehouse
is right down that alley.

26:47.930 --> 26:49.771
Mike, I wasn't even gonna
tell you this...

26:49.963 --> 26:51.536
Ugh. Then don't tell me.

26:51.727 --> 26:53.224
No, you got to hear this.

26:53.415 --> 26:54.566
This is big.

26:54.758 --> 26:56.831
I can't die.

26:57.021 --> 26:58.480
What?

26:58.671 --> 27:00.475
I cannot die.

27:00.667 --> 27:02.355
Motherfucker, you did
a pretty good job of dying

27:02.547 --> 27:04.465
at my wedding
a couple weeks ago.

27:04.656 --> 27:06.075
But I didn't.

27:06.267 --> 27:08.071
Watch.

27:08.262 --> 27:09.451
Hey, Marcus.

27:09.643 --> 27:11.178
("Look at Me Now" by King Flexx
playing)

27:11.369 --> 27:12.905
-Hey!
-(horns honking)

27:13.097 --> 27:14.324
â™ª Yeah, I was born
to be the greatest â™ª

27:14.515 --> 27:15.590
Hey!

27:15.782 --> 27:17.662
â™ª Yeah, I was born
to be your favorite... â™ª

27:17.853 --> 27:20.386
Hey! Marcus! Marcus!

27:20.578 --> 27:22.803
Hey, stop, stop. Hey. Hey!

27:22.994 --> 27:23.992
Marcus!

27:24.184 --> 27:25.219
DRIVER: What are you,
some kind of moron?

27:25.411 --> 27:26.601
MIKE:
Stop, stop.

27:26.792 --> 27:28.442
(engines revving,
tires squealing)

27:28.633 --> 27:29.592
Please stop!

27:31.549 --> 27:32.815
(tires screech)

27:33.007 --> 27:35.194
-Hey!
-Bro!

27:35.385 --> 27:36.344
Slow down!

27:36.536 --> 27:37.917
Crosswalk!

27:38.110 --> 27:39.375
-(tires squeal)
-Ah... (laughs)

27:39.567 --> 27:42.214
-â™ª You cannot stop me â™ª
-(song ends)

27:42.406 --> 27:43.557
Talk to me.

27:43.748 --> 27:45.590
-You got to trust, Mike.
-Mm-hmm.

27:45.782 --> 27:47.086
Trust yourself.

27:47.278 --> 27:49.158
Trust the universe.

27:50.155 --> 27:51.382
Stop that shit, Marcus.

27:51.575 --> 27:53.493
It's not my time, Mike.

27:53.685 --> 27:55.412
Oh, okay, so you're saying

27:55.603 --> 27:57.444
that if I shoot you
in your face,

27:57.636 --> 27:59.324
you're saying
that you won't die?

27:59.515 --> 28:02.509
Fate dictates that you won't
shoot me in the face.

28:02.700 --> 28:05.308
I'm saying...
I'm-I'm saying that you saying

28:05.500 --> 28:07.495
that if I shoot you
in your face,

28:07.687 --> 28:09.413
are you saying you won't die?

28:09.605 --> 28:11.716
Fate doesn't deal
in hypotheticals, Mike.

28:11.908 --> 28:13.902
Â¡Oye! Â¿QuÃ© estÃ¡s haciendo?

28:14.095 --> 28:15.514
I'm going to call the police!

28:15.706 --> 28:16.933
They're already here, ma'am.

28:17.125 --> 28:18.237
Mind your business.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.309
Just go to the beach.

28:20.501 --> 28:22.073
Stop that shit, Marcus.

28:22.266 --> 28:23.839
(Marcus chuckles)

28:24.030 --> 28:26.064
See? You're putting
your gun away. (chuckles)

28:26.256 --> 28:27.828
He's putting his gun away.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.440
(chuckling)

28:29.632 --> 28:32.661
-(mellow music playing)
-(quiet chatter)

28:34.465 --> 28:36.575
Ooh. Mike.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.482
Focus, man.

28:42.674 --> 28:44.170
Yeah, I call this place,
you know,

28:44.362 --> 28:46.511
Creative Space for
Black Imagination, you know.

28:46.703 --> 28:48.583
-That's...
-MIKE: Fletcher.

28:48.775 --> 28:50.194
Oh, my God.

28:50.385 --> 28:51.499
Thank you.

28:51.691 --> 28:53.148
What the hell is this place?

28:53.340 --> 28:55.834
This is my studio gallery.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.137
I'm an artiste now.

28:57.329 --> 28:58.865
Please, you ain't
no damn artist.

28:59.055 --> 29:01.165
(inhales sharply, clicks tongue)

29:01.357 --> 29:03.161
-What do you guys want?
-Captain Howard.

29:03.352 --> 29:05.348
Yeah, I was sorry to hear
what happened to him.

29:05.539 --> 29:06.844
He helped turn my life around.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.686
He told us to talk to you.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.066
Okay. Talk to me.

29:10.258 --> 29:12.100
I just talked to you.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.442
Then say what
you're supposed to say.

29:13.634 --> 29:15.169
-I said what I'm supposed
to say. -You didn't.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.397
Then tell me what
I'm supposed to say.

29:16.589 --> 29:17.930
I've said all I can say.

29:18.123 --> 29:20.003
You fucking with us, beanstalk.

29:20.195 --> 29:21.000
Marcus!

29:21.192 --> 29:22.612
Come on.

29:22.802 --> 29:24.798
Captain Howard saved my life.
I'm not messing this up.

29:24.990 --> 29:26.792
I can't say
what I supposed to say

29:26.985 --> 29:29.171
until you say
what you supposed to say.

29:29.364 --> 29:31.052
Fletcher, just tell us
what you supposed to tell us.

29:31.243 --> 29:32.317
Dumbasses. Look.

29:32.509 --> 29:35.348
Captain Howard
was onto something big.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.649
He didn't trust that you
dumb fucks would figure it out,

29:37.841 --> 29:39.567
so he contacted me.

29:39.759 --> 29:42.714
Because you're stupid
and I'm a genius.

29:42.905 --> 29:46.243
So I protected the information
in something.

29:48.851 --> 29:51.767
In something beautiful.

29:54.836 --> 29:55.949
(sighs)

29:56.141 --> 29:58.175
Flex your face one more time.
Flex it again!

29:58.366 --> 30:00.937
I will blow
your fucking head off.

30:01.128 --> 30:03.698
Would you stop? Come on.

30:04.657 --> 30:08.110
In something
that will live forever.

30:10.796 --> 30:12.024
(silenced gunshot)

30:13.059 --> 30:14.402
-Did you shoot him?
-(people screaming)

30:14.593 --> 30:16.551
(sniffs) I don't think so.

30:16.741 --> 30:19.428
(panicked chatter)

30:19.619 --> 30:21.537
â™ª â™ª

30:26.448 --> 30:27.982
Freeze!

30:28.174 --> 30:30.055
Marcus. Marcus!

30:41.409 --> 30:43.097
("Can't Get Enough of Your
Love, Babe" by Barry White)

30:43.289 --> 30:45.323
â™ª I've heard people say that â™ª

30:46.819 --> 30:49.504
â™ª Too much of anything
is not good for you, baby â™ª

30:49.697 --> 30:50.770
â™ª Ah, no, no â™ª

30:50.962 --> 30:54.262
â™ª But I don't know about that â™ª

30:54.454 --> 30:56.909
-(spits)
-(song slows and distorts)

30:57.101 --> 30:58.673
-(yells)
-(song stops)

30:58.864 --> 31:00.361
You hit?

31:00.552 --> 31:02.357
Nah. Black jelly bean.

31:02.547 --> 31:03.814
Nobody likes that shit.

31:09.147 --> 31:10.911
-Whoa.
-(song resumes)

31:11.102 --> 31:14.134
â™ª My darling, I â™ª

31:14.326 --> 31:16.857
â™ª Can't get enough
of your love, babe â™ª

31:17.050 --> 31:18.623
Hey! Stop that stupid shit!

31:18.813 --> 31:21.959
â™ª Girl, I don't know,
I don't know why â™ª

31:22.151 --> 31:23.877
â™ª I can't get enough
of your love, babe â™ª

31:24.069 --> 31:25.605
I'm not fucking with you! Stop!

31:25.796 --> 31:27.215
(bullets ricocheting)

31:27.407 --> 31:28.789
(song fades)

31:28.981 --> 31:30.899
(distorted roaring)

31:32.202 --> 31:33.508
No! No, no!

31:33.698 --> 31:35.694
-No! No!
-(yells)

31:46.705 --> 31:49.005
I don't give a fuck!

31:49.197 --> 31:51.040
Marcus, stop! No!

32:08.916 --> 32:10.604
(gunfire continues)

32:10.796 --> 32:12.677
(breathing heavily)

32:17.970 --> 32:19.696
-What are you doing?!
-I got this!

32:19.888 --> 32:21.539
But you don't, though!

32:21.730 --> 32:22.728
No. No!

32:24.223 --> 32:25.451
Marcus!

32:25.643 --> 32:27.255
(grunts)

32:28.597 --> 32:30.324
Let's go! Let's move!

32:31.934 --> 32:33.584
(grunts) Marcus!

32:36.960 --> 32:39.263
Burnett and Lowrey
are moving north on 11th.

32:40.950 --> 32:43.061
(engine starts)

32:44.058 --> 32:45.553
(panting, grunting)

32:45.745 --> 32:47.703
(horns honking)

32:56.526 --> 32:58.368
(grunts, yells)

33:00.975 --> 33:02.893
Miami PD! Go!

33:03.086 --> 33:04.007
(tires squeal)

33:04.199 --> 33:05.809
What are you doing?!

33:06.002 --> 33:07.344
I'm fighting crime, baby.

33:07.536 --> 33:08.495
Freeze!

33:17.127 --> 33:18.048
(gasps)

33:20.311 --> 33:21.808
(distorted yelling)

33:21.998 --> 33:23.111
(groaning)

33:25.721 --> 33:27.293
(breathing heavily)

33:34.429 --> 33:36.808
-Mike!
-(engine revving)

33:42.946 --> 33:44.902
(tires squeal)

33:46.551 --> 33:48.469
â™ª â™ª

33:54.339 --> 33:56.219
Have you ever had
a panic attack before?

33:56.411 --> 33:57.370
What?

33:57.561 --> 33:59.365
Ain't nobody have
no damn panic attack.

33:59.556 --> 34:01.052
You're at 165 over 90.

34:01.245 --> 34:02.779
Sweaty, nauseous.

34:02.971 --> 34:04.237
Look, there's no shame
in getting counseling.

34:04.429 --> 34:05.311
-All right. Thank you.
-Mike.

34:05.504 --> 34:06.386
Appreciate you, brother.

34:06.578 --> 34:07.805
Mike, let the man do his job.

34:07.997 --> 34:08.918
-What...
-MIKE: Okay.

34:09.109 --> 34:10.261
Good... good job, man.

34:10.451 --> 34:11.871
Hey, Mike.

34:12.063 --> 34:13.482
What the hell
you panicking about?

34:13.675 --> 34:14.863
I'm not speaking to you.

34:15.056 --> 34:16.283
What'd I do?

34:16.475 --> 34:18.432
(indistinct radio chatter)

34:18.623 --> 34:19.544
You two all right?

34:19.735 --> 34:21.615
Mike had a panic attack.

34:21.808 --> 34:23.688
He didn't. Mike is fine.

34:23.879 --> 34:24.914
What happened?

34:25.107 --> 34:26.565
Rita, you ain't gonna
believe this shit,

34:26.756 --> 34:28.138
-but we got a text from...
-A tip.

34:28.329 --> 34:32.012
We got a tip that Fletcher
had violated his parole,

34:32.204 --> 34:33.777
so we came down here, and...

34:33.968 --> 34:36.884
obviously, he was into some
shit he ain't have no business.

34:37.077 --> 34:38.112
Is that true, Marcus?

34:38.303 --> 34:40.298
Uh, um...

34:41.296 --> 34:42.293
(laughing)

34:42.486 --> 34:44.788
You know, well, you know, I...
I was with Mike.

34:46.207 --> 34:49.545
How could you, of all people,
think Captain Howard was dirty?

34:49.737 --> 34:52.344
I don't want this to be true,
but it would benefit all of us

34:52.537 --> 34:54.801
to do our jobs
and follow the evidence.

34:54.992 --> 34:56.795
And you think
he was stupid enough

34:56.986 --> 34:59.289
to put accounts
in his own name?

34:59.480 --> 35:01.668
-He's being framed.
-By who?

35:01.858 --> 35:03.509
That's what we're trying
to find out.

35:03.700 --> 35:05.158
Rita, come on,
you're smarter than this.

35:05.350 --> 35:08.688
Michael, please do not forget
you're talking to your boss.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.951
I'm trying to protect you here.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.406
I got no footage
for a two-block radius.

35:13.599 --> 35:14.864
What?

35:15.056 --> 35:17.242
They must have killed all CCTV,
all security cams.

35:17.435 --> 35:18.585
I got nothing.

35:18.778 --> 35:21.732
(laughing): At least they ain't
film your panic attack.

35:21.923 --> 35:23.342
(Mike laughs mockingly)

35:23.534 --> 35:24.915
Hey, guys.

35:26.334 --> 35:27.908
-You had a panic attack?
-MIKE: No.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.672
If you want, I can recommend
a good counselor.

35:29.865 --> 35:30.901
I'm good, Dorn. Thanks.

35:31.091 --> 35:34.737
Look, I shot this,
went frame by frame.

35:34.928 --> 35:35.925
Check it out.

35:36.118 --> 35:37.843
All right, not here.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.145
-Dorn, shut it down.
-Yeah.

35:40.338 --> 35:41.949
Hey. Let's go.

35:43.292 --> 35:45.516
So, what is this?

35:45.709 --> 35:46.859
MARCUS:
We're not exactly sure.

35:47.052 --> 35:48.509
(typing)

35:48.701 --> 35:49.698
-Whoa.
-MIKE: Wow.

35:49.889 --> 35:51.769
There you go. There you go.

35:51.962 --> 35:53.458
All right, you fucks.

35:53.649 --> 35:56.565
Now that I know it's you,
here it is.

35:57.678 --> 35:59.711
I don't know how high up
it goes,

35:59.902 --> 36:02.550
but there's corrupt officials
on our side,

36:02.741 --> 36:04.199
and they're working
with the cartel.

36:04.392 --> 36:07.231
This all started smelling funny
about nine years ago.

36:07.423 --> 36:09.915
That shipment of coke we were
about to raid went missing.

36:10.108 --> 36:12.447
You know, I-I kept getting
shut down from above.

36:12.640 --> 36:16.476
So I... I pulled Sanchez
and Ruiz out of retirement.

36:16.667 --> 36:19.007
I had 'em working
on the outside, you know?

36:19.200 --> 36:21.539
They were killed in a car crash
a week later.

36:21.732 --> 36:23.228
That shook me up.

36:23.419 --> 36:25.798
And it's why I never
brought you two in.

36:25.990 --> 36:27.716
Well, shame on me for worrying
about your asses

36:27.909 --> 36:29.557
when you could've saved mine.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.668
But now it's up to you.

36:31.860 --> 36:34.661
Remember the bust back in 2003?

36:34.851 --> 36:38.075
314 pounds of ecstasy?

36:38.266 --> 36:41.796
Well, I held on to the
storage unit, off the books.

36:41.987 --> 36:43.791
That's where
the real files are.

36:43.982 --> 36:45.401
Everything you need
to exterminate

36:45.594 --> 36:47.320
these rat fucks, it's in there.

36:47.512 --> 36:49.698
You're gonna have to finish
what I couldn't.

36:49.891 --> 36:51.233
Please.

36:51.425 --> 36:53.189
Please, boys.

36:53.382 --> 36:55.147
You're my last hope.

36:56.336 --> 36:57.831
(Dorn sighs)

36:58.024 --> 37:00.633
2003, um...

37:00.823 --> 37:03.279
that was the-the Haitian,
Zoe Pound.

37:05.964 --> 37:07.537
Where was their storage locker?

37:07.730 --> 37:09.916
I have no idea. All right.

37:10.108 --> 37:11.834
We need you guys to go down
to the station

37:12.027 --> 37:13.292
and pull
our original case files.

37:13.484 --> 37:14.749
That'll tell us
where the locker is.

37:14.942 --> 37:16.362
Do it quietly and be careful.

37:16.552 --> 37:18.280
We don't know who we can trust.

37:18.471 --> 37:20.236
DORN:
Shit, this is heavy, man.

37:20.427 --> 37:21.348
Um... (clears throat)

37:21.541 --> 37:22.882
I just got something
important to say.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.839
I'm just gonna come out
with it, clear the air.

37:25.032 --> 37:28.637
Uh, the rat is not me, so...

37:28.830 --> 37:30.517
Thanks for that, Dorn.

37:32.282 --> 37:34.009
(sighs) I feel safer.

37:35.927 --> 37:37.269
(quiet chatter)

37:38.919 --> 37:39.878
(grunts)

37:40.069 --> 37:41.987
â™ª â™ª

37:44.021 --> 37:45.363
(exhales sharply)

37:50.159 --> 37:51.272
(gate closes)

37:51.464 --> 37:52.922
(grunts)

37:58.254 --> 38:00.096
(exhales slowly)

38:13.714 --> 38:15.288
(speaking Spanish)

38:19.086 --> 38:21.042
(grunting and groaning)

38:21.233 --> 38:23.343
(excited chatter)

38:41.298 --> 38:44.214
(groans)

38:56.873 --> 38:58.600
(alarm blaring)

38:58.791 --> 39:01.515
(frantic chatter)

39:05.006 --> 39:06.962
(groaning)

39:08.727 --> 39:10.915
MIKE (voice-over):
They just tried to kill my son

39:11.106 --> 39:14.098
because Armando can prove that
Captain Howard was innocent.

39:14.291 --> 39:16.171
Cap was onto
these dirty players.

39:16.362 --> 39:17.628
Armando told you that?

39:17.819 --> 39:20.390
Yes. It's the reason they
wanted Captain Howard dead.

39:20.582 --> 39:22.961
Armando can I.D. the guy
that ordered the hit on Cap.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.149
He have a name?

39:25.147 --> 39:26.029
No.

39:26.222 --> 39:27.258
But a face.

39:28.715 --> 39:30.634
Listen, I know y'all
can do this, all right?

39:30.824 --> 39:33.434
Just transfer Armando.
Get him to Miami.

39:33.626 --> 39:35.198
Get him to a secure location.

39:35.391 --> 39:37.154
We'll-we'll debrief him.
We'll get his testimony.

39:37.347 --> 39:39.418
We'll get some pictures
in front of him.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.608
But please do it now.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.143
These guys are trying
to cover their asses,

39:42.334 --> 39:44.252
and they are not gonna stop.

39:46.478 --> 39:47.859
Do it for Captain Howard.

39:49.623 --> 39:51.772
(sighs) Look, the evidence
against Captain Howard

39:51.963 --> 39:53.728
is overwhelming.

39:53.919 --> 39:56.221
If I'm doing this,
I'm doing it for you.

39:59.137 --> 40:01.515
All right.
Let's transfer Aretas.

40:01.708 --> 40:03.011
You'll accompany him,

40:03.204 --> 40:05.428
get him to igloo here in Miami,
do a debrief.

40:05.621 --> 40:08.038
But I'm sticking my neck out
and I'm trusting you.

40:09.265 --> 40:12.373
If he turns out to be bullshit,
then it's gonna be my ass.

40:12.564 --> 40:15.289
So... don't screw me, Mike.

40:16.248 --> 40:17.552
(cell phone vibrating)

40:17.744 --> 40:19.125
MIKE:
All right.

40:20.122 --> 40:22.501
Thank you. Thank you.

40:24.458 --> 40:25.800
Yeah?

40:25.991 --> 40:27.833
DORN (over phone): We found
Zoe Pound's storage unit.

40:28.024 --> 40:29.405
We'll go get the files,
then take them

40:29.598 --> 40:31.133
to my houseboat
for safekeeping.

40:31.324 --> 40:32.514
All right. Stay on it.

40:32.705 --> 40:34.394
Let me know when you got it.

40:40.071 --> 40:41.990
(siren wails)

40:48.358 --> 40:50.582
Please surrender your firearms.

40:50.775 --> 40:52.385
They will be returned to you
upon touchdown.

41:07.347 --> 41:08.384
You good?

41:09.381 --> 41:10.569
Never been better.

41:10.762 --> 41:13.025
It's about 45 minutes.

41:18.818 --> 41:20.736
Mike, I wasn't even
gonna tell you this,

41:20.928 --> 41:23.269
but in one of our previous
lifetimes together...

41:23.460 --> 41:24.650
Mm-hmm?

41:24.842 --> 41:27.795
...you were a donkey,
and I owned you.

41:28.869 --> 41:30.519
(chuckles)
You were a stubborn ass, Mike.

41:30.710 --> 41:32.975
-Mm-hmm.
-You used to bite and spit.

41:33.165 --> 41:34.893
-You were nasty.
-Mm-hmm.

41:35.084 --> 41:38.307
But I-I was a terrible owner,
you know,

41:38.498 --> 41:40.455
-because I used to beat you.
-Mm-hmm.

41:40.647 --> 41:42.373
Because you wouldn't
listen for shit.

41:42.565 --> 41:45.634
And maybe I beat some kind
of shame into you, Mike.

41:45.826 --> 41:49.241
And now I realize
I was scarring your soul.

41:50.277 --> 41:51.236
You miss your nap?

41:51.426 --> 41:52.693
(sighs)

41:52.884 --> 41:54.995
Mike, I'm trying
to apologize to you.

41:55.186 --> 41:56.184
We don't have your blankie,

41:56.376 --> 41:58.178
but you could just
rest your eyes.

41:58.371 --> 42:00.595
That's exactly how you was
as a donkey.

42:00.788 --> 42:02.974
-Okay. I get it.
-That's that shit there.

42:03.167 --> 42:04.624
You need some help
with your seat belt?

42:04.815 --> 42:06.158
No, donkey.

42:08.728 --> 42:09.880
McGRATH:
Hey.

42:10.071 --> 42:12.066
Bryant, this is Bronson.

42:12.259 --> 42:14.291
The other guys
are on turnaround.

Take a seat.

46:52.579 --> 46:54.767
How the hell did they get
on a federal transport?

46:55.802 --> 46:57.031
We need to split up.

46:57.221 --> 46:58.756
We're gonna stay together.

46:58.949 --> 47:00.560
Says who?

47:02.055 --> 47:03.513
I'm not asking you.

47:03.706 --> 47:05.355
I'm telling you.
We're staying together.

47:05.546 --> 47:07.619
-Fuck out of my way.
-Hey. Where...

-Get the fuck off me.

47:09.306 --> 47:10.918
-Hey! Hey!
-Listen!

47:11.110 --> 47:13.795
Look, you are the only person

47:13.987 --> 47:16.135
who can identify
whoever is doing this.

47:16.327 --> 47:18.783
The only way that
any of us stays alive

47:18.973 --> 47:21.199
is if we get them
before they get us.

47:21.390 --> 47:23.615
There's no us. There is no us!

47:23.807 --> 47:25.073
Damn.

47:25.266 --> 47:27.106
That Lowrey DNA is a bitch.

47:27.299 --> 47:29.063
Y'all some
strong motherfuckers.

47:30.367 --> 47:34.626
Okay. Now, look,
everybody unflex on three.

47:34.818 --> 47:36.391
One. Two.

47:37.389 --> 47:39.038
There you go.

47:39.230 --> 47:42.414
Captain Howard left us files

47:42.606 --> 47:44.141
that's gonna tell us
who's doing this.

47:44.332 --> 47:46.173
Dorn has them.

47:46.366 --> 47:48.130
We just have to get back
to Miami.

47:50.009 --> 47:51.814
You better not slow me down.

47:53.233 --> 47:54.958
Lose your phones.

47:55.151 --> 47:57.222
You keep up with me,
or I leave you in the dirt.

47:58.219 --> 47:59.525
You're in my world now.

â™ª â™ª

48:11.954 --> 48:13.220
Hey, Mike.

48:13.412 --> 48:15.022
Look, we got to think
about this.

48:15.215 --> 48:16.826
I know you want to move
with him,

48:17.017 --> 48:19.090
you know,
because he's your "son."

48:19.281 --> 48:21.659
Whoa. Whoa.
Don't air-quote that.

48:21.852 --> 48:23.194
No, I-I didn't. I'm just saying

48:23.387 --> 48:24.768
I know why you trying
to protect him--

48:24.960 --> 48:25.956
'cause he "family."

48:26.148 --> 48:27.146
Hey.

48:27.338 --> 48:29.141
Moving the air quotes
down to your hips

48:29.332 --> 48:31.059
doesn't un-air-quote them.

48:31.250 --> 48:32.708
Just-just say he's my son.

48:32.901 --> 48:34.741
-He's your son.
-No, no.

48:34.934 --> 48:37.120
Palms up is like
you trying to say,

48:37.313 --> 48:38.923
oh, he's not really my son.

48:39.920 --> 48:40.727
Oh.

48:40.918 --> 48:42.645
Well, your son's getting away.

48:42.836 --> 48:44.179
MIKE:
Shit.

48:44.908 --> 48:46.827
â™ª â™ª

48:51.928 --> 48:53.694
HIRSHBERG: If your men
are on some kind of op,

48:53.885 --> 48:55.152
you might want to pull us in.

48:55.342 --> 48:56.955
Otherwise, it doesn't
look good for them.

48:57.145 --> 48:58.336
Yeah.

48:59.333 --> 49:00.906
-Judy.
-You I.D. the bodies?

49:01.097 --> 49:03.131
Roger.
We got three unaccounted for:

49:03.323 --> 49:06.123
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas.

49:06.314 --> 49:07.581
Motherfuckers.

49:07.772 --> 49:10.151
-Fucking... Shit.
-(siren wailing)

49:10.343 --> 49:11.685
All right. Listen up!

49:11.878 --> 49:15.982
We have three suspects,
armed and dangerous, out there.

49:16.175 --> 49:18.322
And I want them back.

49:18.515 --> 49:20.548
-Let's go.
-(busy chatter)

49:20.739 --> 49:21.968
RITA:
Hold on. Judy.

49:22.158 --> 49:23.771
Three suspects?

49:23.962 --> 49:26.648
What do you think
is happening here?

49:26.839 --> 49:28.910
Wh-What do you think?

49:29.103 --> 49:30.945
Play the audio.

49:31.136 --> 49:32.593
BRYANT (recorded):
U.S. Marshal flight 724.

49:32.785 --> 49:34.282
We have an emergency.

49:34.474 --> 49:35.509
Our prisoner
has escaped custody

49:35.702 --> 49:38.579
with the aid of Miami PD--
Lowrey and Burnett.

49:38.771 --> 49:40.075
There are officers down.
Mayday. Mayday.

49:40.266 --> 49:42.184
Come on, you can't
possibly believe

49:42.376 --> 49:43.911
Mike and Marcus would do this.

49:44.102 --> 49:45.215
Nah, you said it.

49:45.408 --> 49:47.632
Lowrey was obsessed with
getting his son out of prison.

49:47.825 --> 49:49.743
Slow down, Judy.

49:49.934 --> 49:51.661
This isn't Miami, Secada.

49:51.852 --> 49:53.004
These are my fugitives,

49:53.195 --> 49:55.114
and right now the whole world
is my jurisdiction.

49:55.304 --> 49:56.264
You've known them
your whole life.

49:56.456 --> 49:57.492
How can you even suggest...

49:57.683 --> 50:00.638
Do I think that
Mike and Marcus planned this?

50:00.830 --> 50:01.980
Probably not.

50:02.172 --> 50:03.592
But people do things
they wouldn't normally do

50:03.783 --> 50:04.704
when family's involved.

50:04.895 --> 50:07.006
In my experience,
innocent men don't run.

50:07.197 --> 50:08.426
Can we stop and think before...

50:08.617 --> 50:10.496
Are you capable
of doing your job?

50:10.688 --> 50:12.108
'Cause I need to move on.

50:17.363 --> 50:18.821
They survived.

50:19.014 --> 50:20.357
The fuck you mean,
they survived?

50:20.548 --> 50:21.698
No bodies on site.

50:21.891 --> 50:23.962
U.S. Marshals are treating it
as a manhunt.

50:25.229 --> 50:28.144
These guys just refuse to die.

50:29.218 --> 50:30.676
They're wanted men.

50:30.868 --> 50:33.706
(voice-over): Law enforcement
and media are our friends now.

50:33.899 --> 50:35.740
REPORTER:
A manhunt for three fugitives

50:35.931 --> 50:37.697 line:20%
is sending shock waves
across South Florida.

50:37.888 --> 50:39.078
REPORTER 2: Ballistic reports
have matched the bullets

50:39.269 --> 50:40.266
recovered from
the bodies at the...

50:40.459 --> 50:41.839
Are you planning
on dropping out

50:42.032 --> 50:43.797
of the mayor's race
in light of the recent events?

50:43.989 --> 50:45.522
GRICE (on TV): The manhunt
is currently underway.

50:45.715 --> 50:48.054
The FBI is assisting
U.S. Marshals

50:48.247 --> 50:50.433
in bringing these men in.

50:50.625 --> 50:52.236
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas

50:52.429 --> 50:54.691
should be considered
armed and dangerous.

50:54.884 --> 50:57.224
These are individuals
who have killed

50:57.416 --> 50:58.797
fellow law enforcement
professionals.

50:58.988 --> 51:02.556
If you see something,
say something.

51:02.747 --> 51:05.050
Put a bounty on the streets.

51:05.241 --> 51:07.121
(voice-over): Get it
to every gang in the city

51:07.314 --> 51:09.653
-and let them fight for it.
-(cell phones chiming)

51:11.342 --> 51:12.492
Five mil.

51:12.684 --> 51:13.796
(sucks teeth)

51:13.988 --> 51:15.791

these motherfuckers.

â™ª â™ª

51:24.499 --> 51:26.994
MARCUS: The universe
is crazy, ain't it?

51:27.186 --> 51:29.027
Look at us.

51:29.218 --> 51:31.367
I bet none of us thought
when we woke up today

51:31.558 --> 51:33.553
this is where we'd be.

51:33.746 --> 51:35.356
You out of jail.

51:35.548 --> 51:37.888
We going to jail. (chuckles)

51:38.081 --> 51:39.883
This shit is special.

51:41.534 --> 51:44.947
Mike, is there anything you
would like to say to Armando?

51:45.139 --> 51:46.980
Fuck you talking to me
like that? No.

51:47.173 --> 51:48.286
Mike, this is a moment.

51:48.477 --> 51:50.702
Express with your son.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.140
I'm sorry.

52:00.331 --> 52:01.750
That's what I'm talk...

52:01.942 --> 52:03.246
That's what I'm talking...

52:03.439 --> 52:04.360
For what?

52:04.552 --> 52:05.702
MIKE:
For everything, man.

52:05.895 --> 52:10.075
Seems like bad shit happens
to anybody I love, so...

52:10.268 --> 52:12.186
starting to think
maybe I'm cursed.

52:12.377 --> 52:14.257
I just feel like...

52:14.450 --> 52:15.946
maybe I cursed you.

52:17.941 --> 52:19.360
You ain't fucking curse me.

52:19.551 --> 52:21.815
Bad shit happens to everybody.

52:22.850 --> 52:24.308
Ain't always about you.

52:25.344 --> 52:26.496
MARCUS:
Hey, Armando.

52:27.608 --> 52:29.065
I don't know
if I told you this,

52:29.257 --> 52:30.831
but I died
a couple of weeks ago.

52:32.212 --> 52:33.670
-Sorry to hear about that.
-MARCUS: Oh, no.

52:33.860 --> 52:35.932
(chuckling): Best thing
that ever happened to me.

52:36.125 --> 52:37.313
Shit's wild.

52:37.506 --> 52:39.386
But y'all...

52:39.578 --> 52:41.342
y'all the reason I came back.

52:41.533 --> 52:42.991
Hey.

52:43.183 --> 52:45.677
Everybody, bring it in.

52:45.868 --> 52:47.135
Come on, bring it in.

52:47.326 --> 52:48.247
Come on.

52:48.439 --> 52:50.203
-Dude.
-MARCUS: Bring...

52:50.396 --> 52:52.275
-(sighs)
-MARCUS: There you go, Armando.

52:53.196 --> 52:54.348
There you go. There you...

52:54.538 --> 52:57.070
Y'all are some terrible
fucking fugitives.

53:00.217 --> 53:01.866
So, what-what are you,
fucking Marcus Winfrey?

53:02.059 --> 53:03.094
-What?
-What you... See?

53:03.285 --> 53:04.399
-I'm just trying...
-You making us look soft,

53:04.590 --> 53:06.124
like we don't know
how to be on the run.

53:07.582 --> 53:09.845
â™ª â™ª

53:10.037 --> 53:11.418
(dog barking in distance)

53:18.900 --> 53:20.742
We got to get you out of this.

53:21.701 --> 53:23.043
Hey.

53:23.235 --> 53:24.385
That boy hardheaded.

53:24.578 --> 53:25.766
Chip off the old block.

-What are you boys doing?

53:53.235 --> 53:54.500
"Boys"?

53:55.882 --> 53:56.841
(chuckling):
Looks like it.

53:57.032 --> 53:58.568

54:25.998 --> 54:27.033
-MARCUS: Uh, Reba?

It's from her mixtape.

55:13.759 --> 55:15.333
("Bad Boys" country version):
â™ª Bad boys, bad boys â™ª

55:15.524 --> 55:16.943
â™ª Whatcha gonna do? â™ª

55:17.136 --> 55:18.325
-â™ª Whatcha gonna do... â™ª
-(horn honking)

55:18.516 --> 55:19.475
(gasping, shouting)

55:19.668 --> 55:21.777
â™ª Bad boys, bad boys... â™ª

55:21.970 --> 55:23.235
MAN:

55:25.268 --> 55:27.647
We're sorry!

55:27.840 --> 55:29.949
We're not stealing your shit

55:30.141 --> 55:32.250

55:32.442 --> 55:34.592
â™ª Bad boys â™ª

55:34.782 --> 55:37.660
â™ª Ah, whatcha gonna do? â™ª

55:43.569 --> 55:45.409
Did you ever love her?

55:47.289 --> 55:48.479
What?

55:48.670 --> 55:51.203
My mother. You ever love her?

55:52.200 --> 55:53.735
(whispers):
He's expressing.

55:55.691 --> 55:56.996
I definitely loved her.

55:57.187 --> 55:59.182
And then you sold her out.

56:00.179 --> 56:01.293
I made some mistakes.

56:01.484 --> 56:02.827
Like me.

56:03.018 --> 56:04.054
Now, you know that is not
what I was trying...

56:04.247 --> 56:06.203
Now, wait a damn minute,
Armando.

56:06.394 --> 56:08.044
He's trying to make up for it.

56:08.235 --> 56:09.770
He don't owe you a damn thing.

56:09.963 --> 56:11.459
All right, ho-hold on.
Hold on, Marcus.

56:11.650 --> 56:13.146
You're-you're just...
you're being aggressive.

56:13.339 --> 56:14.374
I've been a dad a long time.

56:14.565 --> 56:16.061
He needs to hear this, Mike.

56:16.254 --> 56:17.712
He needs some tough-ass love.

56:17.903 --> 56:21.932
Armando, maybe he does
owe you something, okay?

56:22.123 --> 56:23.773
Your mom being deceived by him,

56:23.965 --> 56:25.346
you being born in prison,

56:25.537 --> 56:27.532
in a web of lies

56:27.725 --> 56:31.945
that turned your ass into
a stone-cold fucking killer.

56:33.248 --> 56:35.282
Yeah. You're a killer.

56:36.395 --> 56:39.272
(scoffs)
But this man, through it all,

56:39.463 --> 56:41.728
has been nothing but solid.

56:43.569 --> 56:45.716
That's some father-of-the-year
shit right there.

56:45.909 --> 56:47.213
-Is it?
-Yeah.

56:47.405 --> 56:48.403
(engine sputtering)

56:48.594 --> 56:50.321
(steam hissing)

56:50.512 --> 56:52.468
Your wack-ass parenting
broke the truck.

56:52.661 --> 56:53.697
My bad.

56:53.888 --> 56:54.847
(engine whining)

56:55.040 --> 56:57.073
Yeah, nah, that's dead.

56:57.264 --> 56:58.492
We're not far from Tabitha's.

56:58.683 --> 57:00.640
Nah, Mike.
You know that woman's crazy.

57:00.833 --> 57:02.136
Yeah, but she likes me.

57:02.329 --> 57:04.247
I don't think she likes you
as much as you think.

57:04.438 --> 57:05.857
The Pony's about
two miles from here.

57:06.050 --> 57:07.124
What's The Pony?

57:07.315 --> 57:10.385
â™ª Because tonight,
tonight, tonight â™ª

57:10.576 --> 57:12.418
-(lively chatter)
-â™ª Oh-oh â™ª

57:12.609 --> 57:13.876
(whooping)

57:14.067 --> 57:17.137
â™ª I'm gonna make it right,
tonight, tonight... â™ª

57:17.328 --> 57:19.592
TABITHA: I need my Instagram.
I need my Friendster.

57:19.783 --> 57:21.203
I need more sex.

57:21.395 --> 57:23.390
I need more men in this club.

57:23.581 --> 57:24.540
You all look beautiful.

57:24.733 --> 57:26.497
Now, get back to work.
(clicks tongue)

57:26.690 --> 57:29.145
Mike Lowrey. Damn.

57:29.336 --> 57:30.371
What up, Tabitha?

57:32.788 --> 57:33.786
So y'all in trouble, huh?

57:33.979 --> 57:35.897
Yeah, uh, we need some help.
Um...

57:36.088 --> 57:37.777
-Well, we need some clothes.
-No shit.

57:37.967 --> 57:40.040
-A ride and some phones.
-MIKE: Mm. Yeah.

57:40.232 --> 57:41.382
Yeah. Guns, too.

57:42.379 --> 57:44.259
Uh, that's my son.
That's Armando.

57:44.452 --> 57:45.986
You got you
a little Spanish son?

57:46.177 --> 57:48.134
Yeah. (sighs)
Yeah, it's a long story.

57:48.327 --> 57:49.823
Um, can you hook us up?

57:51.011 --> 57:53.351
I mean, I got all that,
but what you gonna do for me?

57:53.544 --> 57:55.269
What you mean?
We good for that.

57:55.462 --> 57:57.035
You were.

57:57.226 --> 57:59.452
But you guys
are men on the run now, so...

57:59.643 --> 58:00.871
Well, what you need?

58:01.062 --> 58:02.942
-What I need?
-Mm-hmm.

58:04.017 --> 58:05.704
I need you to eat this pussy.

58:07.354 --> 58:09.043
-(gasps)
-(Mike chuckles)

58:09.234 --> 58:10.538
I'm not doing that, all right?

58:10.731 --> 58:11.920
Whoa. Hold on, Mike.

58:12.111 --> 58:13.723
Hold on. Think about this.

58:13.914 --> 58:16.446
Now, you say
guns and phones, right?

58:16.639 --> 58:18.135
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, well, look,

58:18.326 --> 58:20.398
-you know Mike's a married man.
-So?

58:20.589 --> 58:23.006
So he's gonna need
some plausible deniability.

58:23.199 --> 58:26.919
So I'm-a have you lay down
and, uh, stick out your tongue,

58:27.112 --> 58:28.722
and you gonna
have to do the rest.

58:28.914 --> 58:30.295
I can fuck with that.

58:30.488 --> 58:32.905
-Oh, yeah. Go on and lay down.
-No, Marcus.

58:33.096 --> 58:35.436
All you got to do
is close your eyes, Mike.

58:35.628 --> 58:37.815
-No. -Ooh, I'm-a need
pictures, okay?

58:38.006 --> 58:39.272
-You know how to take pictures,
right? -Tabitha, hey.

58:39.464 --> 58:40.807
-What?
-We don't have a lot of time.

58:40.999 --> 58:42.188
I need you to stop
fucking around.

58:42.381 --> 58:43.646
Oh, I'm not fucking around.

58:43.838 --> 58:45.065
All right. Hey, let's go.

58:45.258 --> 58:46.255
W-Wait. Hold up.

58:46.447 --> 58:48.711
Sit your
motherfucking ass down.

58:48.901 --> 58:50.168
Hey, Tabitha,
what is you doing?

58:50.359 --> 58:51.971
What is you doing?
Sit your married ass down!

58:52.163 --> 58:53.850
You get y'all asses down, too!

58:54.043 --> 58:55.653
-Shit.
-Everybody, sit down!

58:55.846 --> 58:57.687
Hey, I got the bad boys

58:57.879 --> 58:58.800
Let's get that money.

58:58.991 --> 59:01.255
-Hey, Tab.
-Shut the fuck up.

59:01.446 --> 59:03.634
MARCUS:
H-Hold up. I'm confused.

59:03.825 --> 59:05.437
You didn't want him
to licky-licky?

59:05.629 --> 59:07.584
There's a $5 million bounty
on your head.

59:07.776 --> 59:09.579
I need that money.
I was just stalling.

59:09.772 --> 59:11.075
That's-that's cold.

59:11.268 --> 59:12.688
He almost did that shit.

59:12.879 --> 59:14.184
He did not, Marcus.

59:14.375 --> 59:15.987
-I told you she didn't
like you. -(guns cocking)

59:16.179 --> 59:17.483
Get the fuck up.

59:19.554 --> 59:21.741
(Marcus sighs)

59:23.238 --> 59:25.385
The bounty is dead or alive.

59:25.578 --> 59:26.958
Don't be stupid.

59:30.373 --> 59:31.562
Hey, Armando.

59:31.753 --> 59:34.631
If you live,
I'll let you... (moans)

59:34.823 --> 59:35.897
What?

59:36.089 --> 59:38.506
I said, if you live,
motherfucker, holla at me!

59:40.424 --> 59:41.384
He was kind of cute.

59:41.575 --> 59:42.956
-Nah.
-(laughter)

59:43.147 --> 59:44.643
(phone chimes)

59:44.836 --> 59:45.910
JUDY:
We got a tip.

59:46.907 --> 59:48.480
Positive I.D. on our fugitives.

59:48.673 --> 59:50.974
-Let's do this.
-(siren blaring)

59:55.078 --> 59:58.416
Ooh. Mike, I'm about
to make my move.

59:58.608 --> 59:59.950
Oh, no, the fuck you're not.

01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:01.563
You 'bout to go wherever
these men are taking us.

01:00:01.754 --> 01:00:02.828
Oh, I'm not going.

01:00:03.021 --> 01:00:04.440
Now, I'll take
the three in the front.

01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:05.782
You take the six in the back.

01:00:05.974 --> 01:00:08.430
Marcus, we do not have
any weapons.

01:00:08.621 --> 01:00:11.958
-In five, four, three...
-Marcus.

01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:14.874
-(heavy gunfire)
-(men yelling)

01:00:15.067 --> 01:00:16.985
â™ª â™ª

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.805
(tires squeal)

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:28.072
-(bullet ricochets)
-(gasps)

01:00:28.263 --> 01:00:30.181
(muffled hip-hop music playing)

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:34.172
Ah, shit. This motherfucker.

01:00:34.362 --> 01:00:36.665
â™ª Fuckboy, fuckboy,
whatcha gonna do? â™ª

01:00:36.856 --> 01:00:38.008
Hey, yo, Mike.

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.502
Ain't no fun when the rabbit
got the gun, huh?

01:00:40.692 --> 01:00:41.883
Wait, you know this guy?

01:00:42.074 --> 01:00:43.953
Yeah, I hit him with a hammer
a couple years ago.

01:00:44.145 --> 01:00:45.987
You think I forgot about
that fucking ho shit

01:00:46.179 --> 01:00:47.981
you pulled off
at Manny's Prime Rib?

01:00:48.174 --> 01:00:49.900
How the fuck did I let
you two catch me?

01:00:50.092 --> 01:00:51.779
MANNY:
Mike, I want my five million.

01:00:51.972 --> 01:00:53.276
MIKE:
Marcus!

01:00:53.468 --> 01:00:55.999
You see I got the fam with me--
the streets!

01:00:56.192 --> 01:00:59.030
We can do this nice and easy
or we can go to war.

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:01.026
'Cause I'm fucking war-ready!

01:01:01.217 --> 01:01:02.713
MIKE:
What are you doing?

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.474
-(engine revs, tires squeal)
-MIKE: No!

01:01:09.696 --> 01:01:10.884
(groaning)

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:14.222
(grunts)

01:01:15.489 --> 01:01:17.407
-Go, go, go, go!
-(Marcus groaning)

01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:23.622
-(screaming)
-Back up! Back up! Back up!

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:26.652
(tires squealing)

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.683
MIKE:
No! No!

01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:32.714
Windshield wiper fluid
is flammable!

01:01:32.905 --> 01:01:34.478
How the hell am I supposed
to know that?

01:01:34.671 --> 01:01:36.052
I ain't no damn scientist.

01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:38.353
(frantic yelling)

01:01:41.575 --> 01:01:42.804
Everybody, relax.

01:01:42.995 --> 01:01:44.568
The fire's on the outside.

01:01:46.218 --> 01:01:47.139
(gasps)

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:48.250
MARCUS:
Oh, shit.

01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:50.093
Now it's on the inside.

01:01:50.284 --> 01:01:53.008
(gasping, whimpering)

01:01:53.199 --> 01:01:55.310
Shit! Okay.

01:01:56.615 --> 01:01:58.378
(gasps) Okay.

01:02:02.713 --> 01:02:04.632
(sirens blaring)

01:02:07.509 --> 01:02:08.699
(panting)

01:02:14.415 --> 01:02:16.257
-(bullet ricochets)
-(tires squealing)

01:02:17.408 --> 01:02:18.481
-Shit!
-(horn honking)

01:02:26.729 --> 01:02:29.377
Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

01:02:29.568 --> 01:02:31.180
(grunting)

01:02:39.619 --> 01:02:41.652
(heavy gunfire continues)

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.219
(indistinct radio chatter)

01:02:47.867 --> 01:02:49.940
(groaning)

01:02:55.656 --> 01:02:57.420
Shit.

01:02:57.612 --> 01:02:59.492
(panting)

01:03:00.873 --> 01:03:03.290
â™ª â™ª

01:03:08.124 --> 01:03:09.045
(banging)

01:03:09.237 --> 01:03:10.963
MARCUS:
Open the damn door!

01:03:13.879 --> 01:03:15.835
MIKE: We can feel you right
there, boy. Open the door.

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:17.139
DORN (sighs):
Shit.

01:03:23.393 --> 01:03:24.582
(laughs):
Hey.

01:03:24.773 --> 01:03:26.884
-Open up, Muscle Milk.
-Come on, man.

01:03:27.075 --> 01:03:28.687
-What the fuck is you doing?
-Nothing.

01:03:28.879 --> 01:03:30.911
It's just not a great time
for me right now, guys.

01:03:31.104 --> 01:03:32.369
It's not a great time
for us, either.

01:03:32.562 --> 01:03:34.173
Okay, let's reconvene
in like an hour or so.

01:03:34.364 --> 01:03:35.899
Babe, we're out of body wash.

01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:38.622
-MIKE and MARCUS: Whoa...
-Whoa! What the hell?

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.695
(chuckles) We found you guys.

01:03:40.886 --> 01:03:42.497
(muffled laughter)

01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:44.071
We're in a relationship, okay?

01:03:44.261 --> 01:03:45.682
-Oh, okay.
-All right, yeah, that's...

01:03:45.873 --> 01:03:47.637
Sneaking around
has been destroying me.

01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:48.981
It started
about a couple months ago.

01:03:49.172 --> 01:03:50.861
It will not affect
our professional lives.

01:03:51.052 --> 01:03:52.625
Except for that one time
in that van.

01:03:52.817 --> 01:03:55.348
-I am not sorry.
-Nothing to be sorry about.

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:57.842
Yeah, you know,
I-I mean, people do that shit.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:03:58.917
Are you guys okay?

01:03:59.109 --> 01:04:00.490
MIKE: Yeah, we're good.
(stammers) Oh.

01:04:01.678 --> 01:04:02.676
KELLY:
What the fuck?

01:04:02.869 --> 01:04:04.211
MIKE:
Okay. Whoa, whoa.

01:04:04.402 --> 01:04:06.628
Hey, Kelly, Kelly. (stammers)

01:04:06.819 --> 01:04:09.198
I asked you to wait outside
for a second.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:11.730
All right. Kelly, he's with us.

01:04:11.922 --> 01:04:12.997
He can't be here.

01:04:13.187 --> 01:04:14.876
This is my son Armando.

01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:17.639
I know who he is, and
that's why he can't be here.

01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:19.173
I trust you with my life, Mike,

01:04:19.364 --> 01:04:21.130
but I sure as shit
don't trust him.

01:04:21.321 --> 01:04:22.396
I trust him.

01:04:22.587 --> 01:04:24.506
Then take him to your house.

01:04:25.810 --> 01:04:26.692
(clears throat) Hey, Mike.

01:04:26.884 --> 01:04:28.265
Uh, can I have a second
with her?

01:04:28.456 --> 01:04:29.837
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Please.
-Okay. Hey, sweetie.

01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:31.257
Relax. Relax.

01:04:31.448 --> 01:04:32.753
DORN: Come here for a sec.
Come over here for a sec.

01:04:32.946 --> 01:04:34.326
MIKE:
I asked you to wait outside.

01:04:34.519 --> 01:04:35.900
("Only You (1twofeel Reprise)"
by Jay Glavany playing)

01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.587
KELLY:
We could both end up in jail.

01:04:37.779 --> 01:04:40.772
â™ª Burning in my soul... â™ª

01:04:40.963 --> 01:04:42.420
DORN: Why don't we
give them a chance?

01:04:42.613 --> 01:04:44.915
KELLY: Yeah, give them a chance
to kill us all? Hmm?

01:04:45.107 --> 01:04:47.254
This is
some dysfunctional shit.

01:04:50.363 --> 01:04:51.629
-DORN: She's fine.
-MIKE: All right.

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.431
-MARCUS: She don't look fine.
-I'm fine.

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:54.467
Yes, you are.

01:04:54.659 --> 01:04:56.730
-Hey. All right.
-The fuck you say?

01:04:56.923 --> 01:04:58.763
-All right. All right.
-It's the language barrier.

01:04:58.956 --> 01:05:00.183
It was English.

01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:01.947
-Uh...
-It was definitely English.

01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:08.585
Thanks for the drip.

01:05:08.776 --> 01:05:10.119
Yeah.

01:05:10.311 --> 01:05:11.577
Okay, we're aggregating
all the data.

01:05:11.769 --> 01:05:14.723
There's over a hundred hours
of video, 200 units of audio.

01:05:14.914 --> 01:05:17.677
We're indexing all audio, video
and geo-located IP network data

01:05:17.868 --> 01:05:20.707
to create a sight picture
and develop a target package.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.818
Basically, you-you sifting
through all this shit to find

01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:24.620
-the guilty motherfucker.
-Bingo.

01:05:25.579 --> 01:05:26.692
Hey, Dorn.

01:05:26.885 --> 01:05:29.225
-Yeah. -Can you safely get me
into my Ring app?

01:05:29.416 --> 01:05:30.798
-Yeah.
-I want to see my family.

01:05:30.989 --> 01:05:32.446
Yeah, we got
our own VPN and router.

01:05:32.639 --> 01:05:35.247
-Uh, what's your username?
-Marcus37.

01:05:35.439 --> 01:05:36.667
And password?

01:05:36.859 --> 01:05:38.739
Snickers89.

01:05:45.605 --> 01:05:47.332
Almost home, baby.

01:05:47.523 --> 01:05:48.330
Hey, let's get to work.

01:05:48.521 --> 01:05:49.556
We got a lot
to get through here.

01:05:49.748 --> 01:05:51.360
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:53.048
MIKE (voice-over):
We're looking for the guy

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.582
who ordered the hit on Cap.

01:05:54.775 --> 01:05:56.347
Armando can I.D. him.

01:05:56.539 --> 01:05:59.147
â™ª â™ª

01:06:01.719 --> 01:06:03.022
HOWARD (voice-over):
This fucking bastard

01:06:03.214 --> 01:06:04.634
has been my white whale.

01:06:04.825 --> 01:06:06.820
For the last nine years,
I've been trying

01:06:07.012 --> 01:06:08.623
to harpoon the son of a bitch.

01:06:08.815 --> 01:06:10.810
But now it's up to you.

01:06:11.003 --> 01:06:12.921
â™ª â™ª

01:06:28.764 --> 01:06:30.491
DORN:
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:06:30.682 --> 01:06:32.218
Do I walk into your house and
show you how to make cocaine?

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:34.366
Blow it up.

01:06:34.557 --> 01:06:36.284
â™ª â™ª

01:06:41.232 --> 01:06:42.345
It's him.

01:06:48.022 --> 01:06:49.366
You sure?

01:06:49.558 --> 01:06:51.476
ARMANDO: That's the guy
that ordered the hit.

01:06:51.668 --> 01:06:52.894
Bam. Got a name.

01:06:53.086 --> 01:06:54.545
James McGrath.

01:06:54.736 --> 01:06:56.616
Army Ranger School,
counterintelligence.

01:06:56.808 --> 01:06:59.302
(voice-over):
Deployed in Mexico until 2005.

01:06:59.493 --> 01:07:02.026
Worked with the DEA,
Defense AttachÃ©'s Office.

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:04.595
Oh, shit.
He was taken hostage by...

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:07.013
your friends, the cartel.

01:07:07.204 --> 01:07:09.890
Gave up his entire squad
"under duress."

01:07:10.081 --> 01:07:11.194
It's called torture, man.

01:07:11.386 --> 01:07:14.302
DORN:
He was the only survivor.

01:07:18.484 --> 01:07:20.095
MIKE (voice-over):
Cap had him the whole time.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.667
-DORN: Yeah.
-He just didn't know it.

01:07:21.859 --> 01:07:23.203
Hey.

01:07:23.394 --> 01:07:24.967
(cell phone ringing)

01:07:25.159 --> 01:07:26.080
Hello.

01:07:26.272 --> 01:07:27.806
Hey. It's me.

01:07:27.998 --> 01:07:29.493
Damn it, Michael.

01:07:29.686 --> 01:07:30.645
Where are you?

01:07:30.837 --> 01:07:32.217
Rita, we're coming in.

01:07:32.409 --> 01:07:34.020
We got proof that
Captain Howard is innocent.

01:07:34.212 --> 01:07:35.824
What proof?

01:07:36.015 --> 01:07:38.854
We got the guy
that had Captain Howard killed.

01:07:39.046 --> 01:07:40.081
Armando I.D.'d him.

01:07:40.274 --> 01:07:41.769
Same dude that attacked us
on the chopper:

01:07:41.961 --> 01:07:43.152
James McGrath.

01:07:43.343 --> 01:07:45.606
Rita, we got ten years'
worth of files.

01:07:45.798 --> 01:07:47.371
Cap was investigating
these dudes.

01:07:47.562 --> 01:07:49.021
We got 'em all.
It's a whole network.

01:07:49.213 --> 01:07:51.284
We'll surrender to you
tomorrow.

01:07:51.475 --> 01:07:53.049
Hey, look, we got to go.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.350
Michael, what... (sighs)

01:07:57.768 --> 01:07:58.995
You okay?

01:07:59.186 --> 01:08:01.528
Uh... (sighs)
they're coming in.

01:08:01.719 --> 01:08:02.869
What?

01:08:03.061 --> 01:08:06.553
Michael says they have proof
that exonerates Howard,

01:08:06.744 --> 01:08:08.471
explains everything.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.808
-(sighs)
-Do you still love him?

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.188
What?

01:08:14.378 --> 01:08:15.799
No.

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:18.368
-But I believe him.
-(sighs)

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:20.479
Just be careful, babe.

01:08:22.205 --> 01:08:24.431
-Still going to dinner?
-Yeah.

01:08:26.234 --> 01:08:27.806
(sighs)

01:08:27.997 --> 01:08:29.533
McGRATH (voice-over):
They have the files.

01:08:29.724 --> 01:08:32.372
We need to make this look like
cartel business-- Spanish only.

01:08:32.563 --> 01:08:35.478
(busy chatter)

01:08:48.446 --> 01:08:50.594 line:20%
(man in Spanish)

01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:52.665
Shit, shit, shit!

01:08:52.857 --> 01:08:54.008
We need some sleep.

01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:56.195
Hey, guys, we got a problem.

01:08:57.308 --> 01:08:58.727

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.298

01:09:19.635 --> 01:09:22.014
Oh, shit.
Get a unit over to my house.

You got incoming.

01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:36.093
Get the family

01:09:36.285 --> 01:09:38.011
-What?
-Now!

01:09:38.203 --> 01:09:40.122
Yes, sir.

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:44.035
-Come on!
-Hey, what's happening?
Is anybody...

01:09:44.227 --> 01:09:45.530
-REGGIE: There's people

-Okay.

01:09:45.722 --> 01:09:47.410
-(frantic chatter)
-I got to keep y'all safe.
Come here.

01:09:47.602 --> 01:09:48.792
(beeping)

01:09:51.361 --> 01:09:52.590
-Please be careful.
-Okay, Reggie, what's happening?

01:09:52.782 --> 01:09:54.047
-Trust me. I love you.
-Okay, honey.

01:09:54.238 --> 01:09:56.080
Fuck. Fuck.

(grunting and groaning
continue)

01:10:21.054 --> 01:10:22.167
Who the fuck is this guy?

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.664
That's my boy! That's my boy.

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.034
(shuddering breaths)

01:11:14.227 --> 01:11:16.145
-(both screaming)
-(gunshot)

01:11:16.337 --> 01:11:17.219
MARCUS (voice-over):
Oh!

01:11:17.411 --> 01:11:19.520
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
motherfuckers!

01:11:19.712 --> 01:11:21.248
Me snacks is your snacks,
Reggie!

01:11:21.438 --> 01:11:23.703
-REGGIE: All right, come on.
-(panicked gasping)

01:11:26.234 --> 01:11:27.999
(gasps)
Mike, did you see that shit?

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:30.224
MIKE:
Pick up the phone.

01:11:30.416 --> 01:11:32.794
Whoa, Mike. Mike! Mike!

01:11:34.866 --> 01:11:37.130
-(cell phone vibrating)
-(knocking on glass)

01:11:38.664 --> 01:11:40.314
CHRISTINE:
One second.

01:11:44.457 --> 01:11:46.221
-Callie.
-I saw it on TV.

01:11:46.413 --> 01:11:47.757
My mom is after Uncle Mike.

01:11:47.949 --> 01:11:50.519
There is no way that he did
everything that they're saying.

01:11:50.711 --> 01:11:52.283
Sweetheart.

01:11:53.473 --> 01:11:55.083
Everything is going to be okay.

01:11:55.275 --> 01:11:57.271
-Okay.
-Okay?

01:11:57.463 --> 01:11:58.881
Okay?

01:11:59.073 --> 01:12:01.414
(cell phone vibrating)

01:12:08.933 --> 01:12:09.892
Hello?

01:12:10.084 --> 01:12:11.234
It's me. Get out of the house.

01:12:11.426 --> 01:12:12.923
I've got Callie with me.

01:12:13.114 --> 01:12:14.765
Take her and go. Get out now!

01:12:14.956 --> 01:12:17.027
(whistling)

01:12:17.219 --> 01:12:19.022
CHRISTINE:
Callie, get behind me.

01:12:20.366 --> 01:12:21.746
Mike.

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:24.240
(heavy, shuddering breaths)

01:12:25.582 --> 01:12:26.503
(Callie yelps)

01:12:26.695 --> 01:12:27.884
Christine!

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.033
(groaning)

01:12:37.283 --> 01:12:38.588
Mr. Lowrey.

01:12:39.854 --> 01:12:41.234
Who am I speaking to?

01:12:41.427 --> 01:12:43.920
I think you know
who you're speaking to.

01:12:44.112 --> 01:12:46.414
I need your boy.

01:12:47.565 --> 01:12:48.677
And whatever evidence
your beloved captain

01:12:48.869 --> 01:12:50.289
had squirreled away.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.779
And for that,
you can have your wife.

01:12:53.972 --> 01:12:56.235
I'll call you back
with instructions.

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:59.419
-(phone beeps)
-Ah, shit.

01:12:59.611 --> 01:13:00.877
(groans)

01:13:01.068 --> 01:13:02.181
Goddamn it.

01:13:02.373 --> 01:13:04.291
-(Mike groaning)
-I'll go.

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:11.312
Let my life be worth something.

01:13:13.728 --> 01:13:15.187
Never.

01:13:16.913 --> 01:13:18.639
Never.

01:13:18.832 --> 01:13:21.286
(ragged breathing)

01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:25.084
(heavy, ragged breathing)

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:26.925
MARCUS:
Mike.

01:13:28.038 --> 01:13:29.573
He knew.

01:13:29.765 --> 01:13:32.066
What do you mean?

01:13:32.259 --> 01:13:33.907
He knew we were coming in.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.479
He knew we had
Captain Howard's files.

01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:38.972
He knew we had I.D.'d him.

01:13:39.164 --> 01:13:40.162
How?

01:13:40.352 --> 01:13:43.077
Only person you spoke to
was Rita.

01:13:44.075 --> 01:13:45.455
It's not Rita.

01:13:47.988 --> 01:13:50.289
Damn, she got bad taste in men.

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:52.323
-(ringing)
-TV REPORTER: ...Justice
has been

01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:53.666
investigating the corruption of

01:13:53.856 --> 01:13:55.315
the Miami Police Department
with reports suggesting

01:13:55.507 --> 01:13:56.849
the late
Captain Conrad Howard...

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:58.384
-Hello?
-...directed these elements

01:13:58.575 --> 01:14:00.302
in coordination
with the cartels.

01:14:00.493 --> 01:14:03.065
Allegations against Howard,
which look to include

01:14:03.256 --> 01:14:04.675
Lowrey and Burnett
in the operation,

01:14:04.868 --> 01:14:06.555
range from helping cartels
move product

01:14:06.747 --> 01:14:08.090
into the state of Florida

01:14:08.281 --> 01:14:09.355
as well as giving up
key witnesses,

01:14:09.547 --> 01:14:10.699
destruction of evidence

01:14:10.891 --> 01:14:12.617
and even the murder
of fellow officer...

01:14:12.809 --> 01:14:14.804
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

01:14:16.107 --> 01:14:17.220
There's been a breakthrough
in the case.

01:14:17.413 --> 01:14:19.484
I need to get down
to the station.

01:14:20.826 --> 01:14:22.552
I'm gonna head down there.

01:14:25.468 --> 01:14:26.888
I'm coming with you.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.193
(elevator bell dings)

01:14:30.417 --> 01:14:32.106
(Rita sighs)

01:14:33.256 --> 01:14:36.325
(Lockwood takes deep breath)

01:14:39.816 --> 01:14:41.275
Who are you texting?

01:14:41.466 --> 01:14:44.420
Ah, just, um, just...

01:14:44.611 --> 01:14:48.639
just got to get in touch
with the office, JTF.

01:14:48.831 --> 01:14:50.404
Got to let everybody know.

01:14:57.963 --> 01:14:59.497
Hey. Honey. Come on.

01:14:59.689 --> 01:15:01.722
(laughing): Honey,
what are you doing? Stop that.

01:15:01.913 --> 01:15:03.410
What are you doing? Stop it.

01:15:03.602 --> 01:15:05.136
-Let go of me.
-Come on. What are you doing?

01:15:05.328 --> 01:15:06.862
Give it back to me.
Give it back!

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.425
(both breathing heavily)

01:15:12.617 --> 01:15:14.496
(grunting and groaning)

01:15:21.901 --> 01:15:23.820
(both straining)

01:15:28.806 --> 01:15:30.226
-(muffled thump)
-(Rita yelps)

01:15:30.418 --> 01:15:31.952
(gasping)

01:15:32.144 --> 01:15:33.870
(screams)

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:35.865
(Lockwood grunting)

01:15:36.058 --> 01:15:37.438
(elevator bell dings)

01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:39.012
KELLY:
Fuck.

01:15:39.203 --> 01:15:40.853
-(Lockwood groans)
-DORN: Hey, hey, hey, come on.

01:15:41.045 --> 01:15:43.231
-Come on. Come on.
-(Kelly grunting)

01:15:43.422 --> 01:15:44.381
You okay?

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.031
RITA:
Look at the phone.

01:15:46.223 --> 01:15:47.374
(Rita coughing)

01:15:47.567 --> 01:15:49.485
â™ª â™ª

01:15:56.313 --> 01:15:58.001
You know you done
fucked up, right?

01:16:02.912 --> 01:16:04.292
You all right?

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.281
(Rita sighs)

01:16:08.474 --> 01:16:10.008
I'm sorry.

01:16:11.236 --> 01:16:13.462
Ain't got nothing
to be sorry for.

01:16:15.418 --> 01:16:17.337
(indistinct chatter)

01:16:35.175 --> 01:16:36.633
We'll find her, boss.

01:16:39.893 --> 01:16:41.965
I don't trust anybody

01:16:42.158 --> 01:16:45.686
that's not standing right here
right now.

01:16:45.878 --> 01:16:48.066
Every extra person
that we involve

01:16:48.258 --> 01:16:51.402
increases the likelihood
that they know we're coming,

01:16:51.594 --> 01:16:53.359
which increases the likelihood

01:16:53.551 --> 01:16:57.119
that Christine and Callie
don't make it out of there.

01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:59.536
That means no SWAT,

01:16:59.728 --> 01:17:03.488
no Marshals, no backup.

01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:05.214
It's just us.

01:17:07.745 --> 01:17:09.051
(sighs)

01:17:10.355 --> 01:17:12.081
I never meant for it
to go this way.

01:17:12.273 --> 01:17:14.420
How did you mean it to go?

01:17:14.612 --> 01:17:18.718
After 9/11, nobody cared about
drugs coming into this country.

01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:20.098
So, to secure the borders,

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:21.864
we started to work
with the cartels.

01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:23.398
And they kept us informed about

01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:25.278
any terrorist activity
coming our way.

01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:27.042
And it worked.

01:17:27.235 --> 01:17:28.999
We haven't had an attack since.

01:17:30.074 --> 01:17:31.340
We were protecting
this country.

01:17:31.531 --> 01:17:33.258
You were killing cops
and getting rich

01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:35.444
putting drugs
into this country.

01:17:35.635 --> 01:17:36.518
(chuckling):
Rita.

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:37.708
That's why you killed Howard.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:38.782
He was onto you.

01:17:38.974 --> 01:17:40.010
You wanted to cover
your tracks.

01:17:40.201 --> 01:17:42.196
No. That was McGrath.

01:17:42.387 --> 01:17:44.267
He's out of control.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.685
Rita, just take a second.

01:17:46.876 --> 01:17:49.792
I never meant for any of this
to go this way.

01:17:59.497 --> 01:18:02.605
I guess I just need to know
if it was ever real.

01:18:03.603 --> 01:18:05.252
It was always real.

01:18:05.444 --> 01:18:06.711
I panicked.

01:18:06.903 --> 01:18:08.129
I lost control.

01:18:08.321 --> 01:18:10.394
Did you love me?

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:12.042
Yes.

01:18:12.235 --> 01:18:14.114
I swear.

01:18:14.307 --> 01:18:15.381
Well, that means...

01:18:15.573 --> 01:18:16.914
MIKE:
We're good. We got it.

01:18:17.107 --> 01:18:19.025
99% voice match.

01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:24.510
...absolutely nothing to me,
you piece of shit.

01:18:25.931 --> 01:18:27.311
-(tape tearing)
-(muffled grunting)

01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:29.996
â™ª â™ª

01:18:30.188 --> 01:18:31.109
(busy chatter)

01:18:31.301 --> 01:18:32.874
LOCKWOOD (over phone):
Hey. It's me.

01:18:33.065 --> 01:18:34.678
McGRATH:
What the hell's going on?

01:18:34.869 --> 01:18:36.596
You screwed up
is what's going on.

01:18:36.787 --> 01:18:38.476
MIKE and LOCKWOOD'S VOICE:
We've been compromised.

01:18:38.667 --> 01:18:40.317
I'll explain when I get there.

01:18:40.509 --> 01:18:41.889
LOCKWOOD'S VOICE:
We're moving the hostages.

01:18:42.082 --> 01:18:43.577
Cuba, long-term hold...

01:18:43.769 --> 01:18:45.342
MIKE and LOCKWOOD'S VOICE:
...to keep Lowrey, Burnett

01:18:45.534 --> 01:18:48.182
and Aretas quiet
while we sort this out.

01:18:48.372 --> 01:18:49.716
I'm bringing a seaplane.

01:18:49.908 --> 01:18:51.558
I'll be there at first light.

01:18:56.045 --> 01:18:57.810
All right, pack this place up.

01:18:58.002 --> 01:19:00.764
All equipment and personnel,
prepare to move.

01:19:00.956 --> 01:19:03.105
We're moving the hostages
out of the country.

01:19:04.141 --> 01:19:06.059
(busy chatter)

01:19:16.992 --> 01:19:18.565
What happened to your hand?

01:19:26.659 --> 01:19:29.154
They call that
a Colombian manicure.

01:19:31.839 --> 01:19:33.488
(yelling in pain)

01:19:35.023 --> 01:19:36.826
McGRATH:
What's so great about it

01:19:37.018 --> 01:19:40.201
is it's the maximum amount
of pain, but you don't die.

01:19:40.393 --> 01:19:42.273
(shuddering, breathing heavily)

01:19:45.150 --> 01:19:48.566
So now you've decided to be
the one holding the pliers.

01:19:49.677 --> 01:19:51.980
Everybody breaks.

01:19:52.172 --> 01:19:53.744
Everyone.

01:19:53.937 --> 01:19:58.271
Your husband is gonna
kneel down in front of me

01:19:58.462 --> 01:20:01.455
and beg for your lives.

01:20:01.648 --> 01:20:04.025
And then you're gonna
watch me kill him.

01:20:06.788 --> 01:20:08.668
You don't know my husband.

01:20:08.859 --> 01:20:11.966
Well, not officially, but...

01:20:12.159 --> 01:20:14.192
I look forward
to seeing him again.

01:20:20.521 --> 01:20:22.440

("Bad Boys" by Inner Circle):
â™ª Bad boys... â™ª

01:20:32.645 --> 01:20:34.180
Mm-mm.

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:36.175
Come on, Mike.

That's enough.

abandoned amusement park.

01:21:14.959 --> 01:21:15.995
There should be no civilians.

Plane is gonna land
from the south

01:21:18.067 --> 01:21:19.334
on the one side.

01:21:19.525 --> 01:21:22.403
Marcus and I will be
on the plane.

Armando's gonna make his way
in the water-- the two side.

01:21:26.201 --> 01:21:30.152
Kelly, Rita, this road is
one way in, one way out.

01:21:30.343 --> 01:21:31.878
You're holding that road.

01:21:34.103 --> 01:21:35.638
Dorn, you're gonna
control the air.

01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:36.981
DORN (voice-over):
Drones in the air.

01:21:37.172 --> 01:21:39.551
Jamming is active.
Comms are secure.

01:21:39.743 --> 01:21:42.275
As far as they know, Lockwood
is on his way with the plane

01:21:42.467 --> 01:21:45.421
to move the hostages to Cuba.

01:21:45.612 --> 01:21:47.606
The second they get close
to the plane with the hostages,

01:21:47.798 --> 01:21:48.949
it's quick kills.

01:21:49.142 --> 01:21:50.445
Neutralize all threats.

01:21:50.637 --> 01:21:52.940
These motherfuckers killed
a lot of good cops.

01:21:53.132 --> 01:21:55.012
They have my wife.
They have Callie.

01:21:55.203 --> 01:21:56.891
They attacked our families.

01:21:57.083 --> 01:21:58.925
We're not losing today.

01:21:59.115 --> 01:22:01.725
â™ª Bad boys â™ª

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.067
MIKE:
Hey.

01:22:04.218 --> 01:22:06.521
We get on the ground,
you even flinch,

01:22:06.712 --> 01:22:08.631
you'll be dead in .24 seconds.

01:22:08.821 --> 01:22:10.088
I concur.

01:22:11.545 --> 01:22:13.732
PILOT: I got one lookout
on the platform outside.

01:22:13.925 --> 01:22:16.456
I got one sniper
on the roof of building two.

01:22:16.648 --> 01:22:18.221
Tee those up.

01:22:20.868 --> 01:22:22.095
Everybody, keep moving.

01:22:22.287 --> 01:22:24.128
-What are those?
-Gators.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.738
I thought it was
an abandoned gator park.

01:22:26.929 --> 01:22:28.157
Abandoned by humans.

01:22:29.231 --> 01:22:30.383
DORN: It's actually
an old amusement park.

01:22:30.574 --> 01:22:31.572
It sat on ten acres.

01:22:31.763 --> 01:22:33.452
Abandoned in 2017
after Hurricane Irma.

01:22:33.643 --> 01:22:35.370
DORN (over radio):
Their main attraction was

01:22:35.561 --> 01:22:38.285
an albino alligator named Duke,

01:22:38.476 --> 01:22:41.660
who was 16 feet long,
900 pounds.

01:22:41.853 --> 01:22:44.040
"And legend has it
he's still there"?

01:22:44.231 --> 01:22:45.843
Fuck that.

01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:01.533
Armando's at his QTH.

01:23:10.971 --> 01:23:12.851
â™ª â™ª

01:23:25.817 --> 01:23:27.351
DORN:
Hostages are coming out now.

01:23:27.543 --> 01:23:28.925
McGrath plus three.

01:23:29.117 --> 01:23:30.767
Everybody, stay calm.

01:23:30.958 --> 01:23:32.608
MIKE (sighs):
All right.

01:23:34.565 --> 01:23:36.444
(Mike breathing heavily)

01:23:41.202 --> 01:23:43.120
-Mike.
-(heavy breathing continues)

01:23:44.692 --> 01:23:46.265
Mike, do you have the shot?

01:23:46.457 --> 01:23:47.915
MIKE:
Negative. I do not have a shot.

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:50.753
I do not have a shot.
(continues breathing heavily)

01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:55.242
-Mike, he's right there.
-I don't have it.

01:23:55.433 --> 01:23:57.160
I don't have it.

01:23:57.352 --> 01:23:59.040
(breathing sharply)

01:24:02.301 --> 01:24:04.832
They stopped. Why'd they stop?

01:24:05.983 --> 01:24:07.940
(growling)

01:24:10.549 --> 01:24:13.158
(wood creaking)

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:17.262
(growling)

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:19.411
Shit.

01:24:22.403 --> 01:24:23.708
Let's go.

01:24:29.386 --> 01:24:30.958
(growling)

01:24:33.299 --> 01:24:34.756
Armando,
they're closing in on you.

01:24:34.949 --> 01:24:36.636
-Do they see him?
-I don't know.

01:24:36.828 --> 01:24:39.092
Mike, now. Your chance is now.

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.278
(over radio): They can see him.
They know we're here.

01:24:41.469 --> 01:24:42.928
(Mike breathing sharply)

01:24:44.117 --> 01:24:45.806
MIKE: I don't have it.
Negative. Negative. Negative.

01:24:45.996 --> 01:24:47.762
You got to take
the fucking shot.

01:24:47.953 --> 01:24:49.871
â™ª â™ª

01:25:01.918 --> 01:25:03.760
(groaning)

01:25:04.719 --> 01:25:06.406
(alligator snarling)

01:25:06.598 --> 01:25:08.209
Armando's burnt.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.089
Shit.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.662
Full green! Engage!

01:25:11.853 --> 01:25:14.002
Kelly, get us there.
Go, go, go!

01:25:18.223 --> 01:25:20.064
(gunfire)

01:25:36.137 --> 01:25:38.132
Contact, west dock side.

01:25:39.091 --> 01:25:40.818
(grunts) Sh...

01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:42.315
(gasps)

01:25:43.351 --> 01:25:45.728
-(gunfire continues)
-(gasping, grunting)

01:25:45.921 --> 01:25:47.916
-Dorn, take out that sniper!
-Shit.

01:25:48.108 --> 01:25:49.757
Sending the drone.

01:25:58.196 --> 01:25:59.578
Got him.

01:26:08.172 --> 01:26:09.975
(breathing heavily)

01:26:10.167 --> 01:26:12.085
(muffled, distorted gunfire)

01:26:13.312 --> 01:26:15.806
(heavy breathing continues)

01:26:21.253 --> 01:26:22.979
(distorted):
Not now, Mike!

01:26:23.171 --> 01:26:24.706
Not now!

01:26:24.897 --> 01:26:27.354
-(gunfire continues)
-(pained grunting)

01:26:28.504 --> 01:26:30.423
(heavy breathing continues)

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.803
It's okay.

01:26:46.995 --> 01:26:48.569
Not your fault.

01:26:55.818 --> 01:26:58.274
MARCUS: Cut that
bitch-ass shit out, Mike!

01:26:58.465 --> 01:27:00.998
I need Nasty Mike. Nasty Mike!

01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:03.760
Bad shit happens, but
that doesn't mean you're bad.

01:27:03.952 --> 01:27:05.832
-Do that donkey shit, a'ight?
-(growling)

01:27:06.023 --> 01:27:07.789
That's what I'm talking about.
That shit right there.

01:27:07.979 --> 01:27:09.630
That's that shit right there.

01:27:09.821 --> 01:27:11.510
Bad boy! Bad boy!

01:27:11.702 --> 01:27:13.428
Bad Boy Mike! All right?

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.844
â™ª You're the Big Bad Wolf
in the neighborhood â™ª

01:27:16.037 --> 01:27:18.223
BOTH: â™ª Not bad meaning bad
but bad meaning good â™ª

01:27:18.415 --> 01:27:20.103

MIKE: Dorn, take out
the vehicles on the four side.

01:27:49.374 --> 01:27:50.333
Copy.

01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:54.361
â™ª There it is â™ª

NICOLE:
Sir! We're taking heavies.

01:28:00.115 --> 01:28:01.459
We lost the trucks
and three guys outside.

01:28:01.650 --> 01:28:02.686
Goddamn it!

01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:03.913
(Christine and Callie
grunting, whimpering)

01:28:04.106 --> 01:28:05.486
Set firing positions,
both sides.

01:28:05.678 --> 01:28:06.791
-Let 'em in.
-Go.

we need eyes inside. Go now.

Come on. Come on. Get up.

01:34:30.503 --> 01:34:32.421
(Callie panting)

01:34:38.482 --> 01:34:40.400
(Marcus breathing heavily)

01:34:48.379 --> 01:34:49.492
(Christine yells)

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:51.448
Go. I'll slow you down.

01:34:54.825 --> 01:34:56.282
Eyes on location.

01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:03.648
(groaning)

01:35:10.784 --> 01:35:12.702
(grunting)

01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:18.955
Oh, shit.

01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:21.985
You alive?

01:35:23.136 --> 01:35:25.016
(grunts, groans)

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.730
Shit. Okay. Hey.

01:35:34.761 --> 01:35:36.104
Rita, stop this.

01:35:36.295 --> 01:35:37.523
You don't want to shoot me.

01:35:37.715 --> 01:35:38.598
You're right.

01:35:38.789 --> 01:35:40.708

01:35:53.865 --> 01:35:55.784
(muffled screaming)

01:35:58.507 --> 01:36:00.502
-Ow! Ow.
-Come here.

01:36:00.695 --> 01:36:01.999
-Okay, okay. It's okay.
-Ow.

01:36:02.997 --> 01:36:05.259
-I fucking hate politicians.
-Shh.

01:36:05.452 --> 01:36:07.524
(siren blaring)

01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:13.125

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.510
CALLIE (panting):
Okay. Okay, here.

01:36:42.702 --> 01:36:43.699
-ARMANDO: Put me down.
-Okay.

01:36:43.892 --> 01:36:44.851
-It's okay.
-You okay?

01:36:45.043 --> 01:36:46.538
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

01:36:47.574 --> 01:36:49.033
Hey.

01:36:51.872 --> 01:36:53.137
Thank you.

01:37:07.638 --> 01:37:09.941
(thunder crashes)

01:37:13.124 --> 01:37:15.542
I've been here before.

01:37:17.996 --> 01:37:19.417
Oh, shit.

01:37:19.609 --> 01:37:21.642

(McGrath whistles)

01:37:41.706 --> 01:37:43.201
MIKE:
How did you let him catch you?

01:37:43.394 --> 01:37:45.197
He's sneaky as hell, Mike.

01:37:45.389 --> 01:37:47.115
McGRATH: Your wife and I
were having a debate.

01:37:47.307 --> 01:37:49.992
She seems to have
an inflated impression of you.

01:37:50.184 --> 01:37:52.562
-Mike.
-Hey, bae.

01:37:52.754 --> 01:37:54.749
Nevertheless, this is
the end of the road.

01:37:54.941 --> 01:37:56.975
One of them is about to die.

01:37:57.166 --> 01:37:59.660
-(whimpers)
-You choose.

01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:05.645
What you don't know,
Mr. McGrath,

01:38:05.836 --> 01:38:07.792
is one of 'em can't die.

01:38:09.596 --> 01:38:11.169
Who you talking 'bout?

01:38:11.361 --> 01:38:13.970
A wise man told me I was gonna
have to make a hard choice.

01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:16.195
You need to check
with that motherfucker

01:38:16.386 --> 01:38:18.266
before you out here
choosing shit.

01:38:18.457 --> 01:38:20.375
McGRATH: You have
five seconds, Mr. Lowrey.

01:38:20.567 --> 01:38:21.988
We gonna need
some more time, sir.

01:38:22.178 --> 01:38:24.327
Four, three...

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.553
Mike, don't you do
no dumb shit.

01:38:26.745 --> 01:38:27.895
...two...

01:38:28.086 --> 01:38:29.353
(groans)

01:38:34.341 --> 01:38:36.182

01:38:43.893 --> 01:38:46.156
-Mike. Mike.
-Hey. Hey. I'm here.

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.571
Motherfucker done shot me.

01:38:49.763 --> 01:38:51.104
-Oh, damn.
-Here.

01:38:51.296 --> 01:38:52.563
-No, Mike.
-Okay. Just let me check it.

01:38:52.755 --> 01:38:54.135
-Let me see.
-Your donkey ass shot me again.

01:38:54.328 --> 01:38:55.708
-Let me look at it. Just...
-Don't touch me

01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:56.897
with your donkey hooves, Mike.

01:38:57.089 --> 01:38:58.777
-Just... Look, what you...
-Damn, man.

01:38:58.969 --> 01:39:01.042
Listen, I had to fucking
take the shot.

01:39:01.233 --> 01:39:02.613
-No, Mike. No.
-Marcus.

01:39:02.805 --> 01:39:04.034
Let me take a look, Marcus.

01:39:04.226 --> 01:39:05.491
You see that shit, Christine?

01:39:05.683 --> 01:39:06.873
Look, I shot you in your vest.

01:39:07.065 --> 01:39:08.829
-Stop bitching.
-It don't matter, okay?

01:39:09.021 --> 01:39:11.399
You see what you done devoted
your life to, Christine?

01:39:11.591 --> 01:39:12.934
JUDY (over radio):
I've got eyes on Aretas.

01:39:13.125 --> 01:39:14.890
-Moving in.
-Shit. That's Judy.

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:17.192
Armando, do you copy?

01:39:17.384 --> 01:39:19.418
(over radio):
Armando, do you copy?

01:39:21.182 --> 01:39:21.949
Shit.

01:39:22.141 --> 01:39:23.062
CALLIE:
Mom!

01:39:23.254 --> 01:39:24.405
Mom, don't.

01:39:24.596 --> 01:39:26.131
Get away from her.

01:39:26.323 --> 01:39:28.241
-CALLIE: Mom.
-Now!

01:39:28.432 --> 01:39:30.006
Mom, listen to me.
You don't understand.

01:39:30.198 --> 01:39:31.847
Callie, I need you
to listen to me.

01:39:32.039 --> 01:39:34.187
I want you to step slowly
to your right

01:39:34.378 --> 01:39:35.261
and walk towards me.

01:39:35.453 --> 01:39:36.758
Mom, Mom, I'm fine, okay?

01:39:36.949 --> 01:39:40.709
Callie, I need you
to move out of the way.

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:42.321
Mom.

01:39:42.512 --> 01:39:43.548
Mom, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

01:39:43.739 --> 01:39:45.696
Mom, he saved me. Stop!

01:39:45.887 --> 01:39:46.923
Judy! Judy!

01:39:47.116 --> 01:39:48.496
-Back off, Mike!
-Judy. Judy.

01:39:48.688 --> 01:39:50.147
Put the gun down!

01:39:51.719 --> 01:39:53.368
He saved my life.

01:39:57.396 --> 01:39:59.430
Please, Mom.

01:39:59.622 --> 01:40:01.502
(breath trembling)

01:40:06.183 --> 01:40:07.793

01:40:16.119 --> 01:40:18.458
(gasping)

01:40:19.878 --> 01:40:21.988
Are you hit? Are you hit?

01:40:22.179 --> 01:40:23.907
I'm good.

01:40:24.097 --> 01:40:25.633
You good?

01:40:30.005 --> 01:40:32.231
You did good. You did good.

01:40:32.423 --> 01:40:34.111
HIRSHBERG (over radio):
Howard, where are you?

01:40:37.871 --> 01:40:39.596
Howard, do you copy?

01:40:41.591 --> 01:40:44.047
Howard, what's your location?

01:40:48.266 --> 01:40:49.648
Go.

01:40:51.182 --> 01:40:52.641
Before I change my mind.

01:40:54.444 --> 01:40:56.668
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:41:01.311 --> 01:41:02.653
(both grunting)

01:41:02.845 --> 01:41:05.261
Here. You good? You good?

01:41:05.453 --> 01:41:07.564
Hey. Take this.

01:41:07.756 --> 01:41:09.289
Head south.

01:41:09.482 --> 01:41:10.939
-Don't look back.
-Hey.

01:41:11.131 --> 01:41:12.320
I got it.

01:41:12.513 --> 01:41:14.085
Be good.

01:41:14.278 --> 01:41:15.850
It's not up to you, Detective.

01:41:20.377 --> 01:41:22.296

01:41:26.746 --> 01:41:28.664

â™ª â™ª

01:41:58.203 --> 01:41:59.815
Come on, come on.
We got injured cops here.

01:42:00.006 --> 01:42:02.116
And you, I need you
to bring the writ to me now.

01:42:02.309 --> 01:42:03.919
-(Dorn groaning)
-KELLY: I know, I know, I know.

01:42:04.111 --> 01:42:05.645
-How is he?
-You know, pulling through.

01:42:05.837 --> 01:42:06.911
DORN:
Ow.

01:42:07.104 --> 01:42:09.022

â™ª â™ª

01:42:12.666 --> 01:42:14.316
Don't kiss him, Christine.

01:42:14.507 --> 01:42:16.310
Mike, in our next life,

01:42:16.502 --> 01:42:18.652
you coming back
as a pair of my shoes.

01:42:18.843 --> 01:42:20.223
And I ain't gonna wear
no socks,

01:42:20.415 --> 01:42:22.565
and I'm-a step
in all kind of shit.

01:42:22.756 --> 01:42:24.329
REPORTER (voice-over):
Miami DA and mayoral candidate

01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:26.745
Adam Lockwood and former
Army Ranger James McGrath

01:42:26.937 --> 01:42:28.702
were killed this morning in a
firefight in the Florida Keys.

01:42:28.894 --> 01:42:30.429
REPORTER 2: It is believed
that Lockwood and McGrath were

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:32.500
the key links between Miami
law enforcement and cartels...

01:42:32.692 --> 01:42:33.843
REPORTER 3:
The late Captain Howard

01:42:34.035 --> 01:42:35.263
has been fully exonerated.

01:42:35.454 --> 01:42:37.219
Coconspirators are
currently being rounded up

01:42:37.410 --> 01:42:39.405
by the FBI and the Miami PD.

01:42:39.597 --> 01:42:40.979
REPORTER 4:
The search for convicted killer

01:42:41.170 --> 01:42:43.011
Armando Aretas continues.

01:42:43.203 --> 01:42:45.352
The fugitive remains at large.

01:42:49.994 --> 01:42:52.565
("Salsa" by BLKCITY playing)

01:42:52.756 --> 01:42:53.868
â™ª How I always end up

01:42:55.289 --> 01:42:56.171
-MIKE: My people.
-CHRISTINE: Where's Theresa?

01:42:56.363 --> 01:42:58.319
She's with Little Marcus
by the swings.

01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:59.661
Hey. I'm about
to hook y'all up.

01:42:59.854 --> 01:43:01.120
-I'm about to hook you up.
-Please. We're starving.

01:43:01.311 --> 01:43:02.500
Watch this.

01:43:03.536 --> 01:43:04.879
Partner.

01:43:05.992 --> 01:43:07.833
What's all this?

01:43:08.024 --> 01:43:10.134
What...
Why you got on an apron?

01:43:10.327 --> 01:43:12.052
Work on my grill skills.

01:43:12.245 --> 01:43:14.317
No, Mike,
you got to earn the grill.

01:43:14.509 --> 01:43:17.271
This takes seasonings
and temperatures.

01:43:17.463 --> 01:43:19.074
You can't just be cooking
on my grill.

01:43:19.266 --> 01:43:21.836
Your grill?
Joker, this is a public park.

01:43:22.028 --> 01:43:24.023
You don't own
every grill you see.

01:43:24.215 --> 01:43:25.480
You know what, Mike?

01:43:25.672 --> 01:43:28.395
Why don't you go make some
potato salad and set the table.

01:43:28.588 --> 01:43:30.007
Oh, you talking dirty.

01:43:30.198 --> 01:43:32.308
Now, look, I-I don't know
what you got going on

01:43:32.501 --> 01:43:34.381
with your barbecue dictatorship
in your mind,

01:43:34.573 --> 01:43:35.761
but I ain't the one.

01:43:35.953 --> 01:43:37.718
I'm cooking on this grill
whether you like it or not.

01:43:37.909 --> 01:43:39.138
-Hey, Mike...
-Excuse me, sirs.

01:43:39.330 --> 01:43:41.133
You're not...

01:43:41.325 --> 01:43:43.128
Why you...
What you doing, Reggie?

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:45.352
Request permission
to cook my chicken.

01:43:46.618 --> 01:43:49.036
(Mike and Marcus laughing)

01:43:49.227 --> 01:43:51.260
Permission denied, Reggie.
Go ahead somewhere, man.

01:43:51.452 --> 01:43:53.447
Take your smock off
and go play with the kids.

01:43:53.639 --> 01:43:55.596
Listen, this is the...
this is the man area

01:43:55.788 --> 01:43:56.861
of the-the barbecue.

01:43:57.053 --> 01:43:58.435
-Yeah.
-Look, you know what?

01:43:58.627 --> 01:43:59.930
All due respect, we appreciate

01:44:00.122 --> 01:44:01.963
that you did save people
that we love.

01:44:02.156 --> 01:44:03.613
-We appreciate that, right?
-Yeah, we appreciate that.

01:44:03.805 --> 01:44:05.800
-We appreciate that
from here, Reggie. -Yeah.

01:44:05.992 --> 01:44:08.523
-Now, back the fuck up.
-Yeah.

01:44:08.715 --> 01:44:10.480
All right, look, I'm-I'm
willing to compromise with you.

01:44:10.672 --> 01:44:12.437
You can work that half
of the grill-- it's small--

01:44:12.628 --> 01:44:13.703
and I'll work this half, but...

01:44:13.895 --> 01:44:15.813
Is he still standing there?

01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:18.767
Yes, he is.

01:44:18.958 --> 01:44:20.224
Huh. That's weird.

01:44:20.417 --> 01:44:21.568
Yeah.

01:44:21.775 --> 01:44:24.231
He think he hard now.

01:44:24.407 --> 01:44:26.440
You need to let
that motherfucker know

01:44:26.631 --> 01:44:29.126
he ain't cooking no chicken
out here today.

01:44:29.317 --> 01:44:33.498
